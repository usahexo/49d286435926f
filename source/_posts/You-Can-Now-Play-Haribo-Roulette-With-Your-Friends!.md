#  What Type of Gelatin is in Your Haribo?

Gummy bears are one of the most popular candies in the world, and for good reason: they're delicious. But what's in them? And more importantly, what's in their gelatin?

The gelatin in gummy bears is Type B, which comes from pork skin and bones. This means that the gummy bears are not vegetarian or vegan-friendly, unless they are made with a vegan gelatin substitute. Some brands do offer vegan-friendly gummy bears, but they can be harder to find.

If you're looking for a healthier option, there are some gummy bears made with fruit juice instead of gelatin. These are often labeled as "gelatin-free" or "made with organic juice." However, they tend to be more expensive and may not be as tasty as the traditional gummy bears.

So now you know: if you're looking for a tasty and healthy snack, go for the gummy bears! Just make sure to check the ingredients list to see if they're vegan-friendly.

#  Not All Gelatins are Created Equal 

Gelatin, derived from collagen in animal connective tissue, has been used for centuries as a thickening agent in food and drink. Today, it is one of the most popular ingredients in the confectionery industry. In particular, gelatin is used as a stabilizer, thickener and texturizer in a variety of products, from Jell-O to gummy bears.

But not all gelatins are created equal. There are two main types of gelatin: Type A, derived from mammalian skin and bones, and Type B, derived from fish skins and scales. The two types have different properties and are used in different applications.

Type A gelatin is the most common type of gelatin. It is soluble in hot water and is used extensively in food production. It forms a firm gel and is often used to thicken sauces, soups and desserts.

Type B gelatin is less soluble than Type A gelatin but forms a stronger gel. It is mainly used in the production of jellies and jams.

Both Types A and B gelatin are Edible Gelatin Sheets .




While both Type A and B gelatin are edible, Type B gelatin has some unique qualities that make it better suited for some applications than Type A. For example, Type B gelatin is less soluble than Type A but forms a stronger gel, making it ideal for producing jellies and jams. Additionally, because it comes from fish skin, Type B gelatin has an iodine content that can give products a characteristic seafood flavor. This makes it a good choice for products like sushi rolls or smoked salmon.

So if you're looking for a versatile ingredient to add thickness and stability to your confectionery creations, look no further than gelatin!

Playing games is always a fun way to pass the time, especially if you’re playing with your favorite gummy bears! In this game, you will need a lot of gummy bears, some dice, and a bowl or container to put them in.

To start, place all of the gummy bears into the bowl or container. Then, roll the dice and pick that number of gummy bears up from the bowl. If you roll a number that has already been picked up, then you must replace those gummy bears back into the bowl and then re-roll. The player who picks up the last gummy bear wins!

This game is perfect for any occasion and it’s also a great way to get your kids involved in some friendly competition. Be sure to have lots of gummy bears on hand so that everyone can join in on the fun!

#  Sands Casino to Stop at Caesars Palace in Atlantic City

Atlantic City, NJ --- The Sands Casino is stopping it's services at the Caesars Palace in Atlantic City. The casino announced today that the decision was made after much deliberation and discussion. It is said that the company plans to reevaluate their footprint in the market and decide what avenue to take next.

The Sands Casino first opened in May of 2016 as an adjunct to the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas. At that time, there were high hopes for a successful venture, but things haven't quite panned out as planned. Some industry insiders are saying that this move may be an indication that the Sands is looking to leave the Atlantic City market altogether.

Caesars Palace has been in operation since 1978 and has been known as one of the top casinos in Atlantic City. It's unclear what will happen to the property now that the Sands is leaving, but it's likely that another casino operator will step in and take over.

On Thursday, July 12th, the Associated Press reported that the Sands Casino was in talks to purchase Caesars Atlantic City hotel-casino for $1.3 billion. This move would put the Sands in control of two of the city's eleven casinos.

The potential acquisition would come as part of a larger trend in the industry, as casino companies look to expand their holdings in order to compete with new gaming destinations popping up across the country. For example, MGM Resorts purchased Treasure Island Resort and Casino in Iowa in March for $860 million.

Caesars Atlantic City is one of the city's oldest and most iconic casinos, but it has been struggling in recent years. The company that owns it, Caesars Entertainment, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year.

In response to the news of the possible sale, shares of both Sands and Caesars rose sharply on Wall Street.

It is still unclear whether or not a deal will be reached, but if it does go through it would be one of the largest casino acquisitions in history.

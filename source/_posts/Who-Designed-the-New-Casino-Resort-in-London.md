#  New Casino Resort Had Unclear Origins 

The new casino resort in town had an unclear origin. The casino's developers refused to say where the money came from to build the massive complex, leading some to speculate that the funds may have been illegally obtained.

The casino was a huge hit with locals and tourists alike, and it quickly became one of the most popular destinations in town. But despite its popularity, the casino remained mired in controversy. Local residents and business owners complained that the casino was hurting their businesses, and that the large influx of people was causing traffic and other problems in the area.

The casino's developers continued to insist that they had done nothing wrong, and that they had followed all of the appropriate procedures in building and opening the casino. But many people remained skeptical, and there were rumors that the casino's origins were not as innocent as the developers claimed.

#  Mysterious Casino Resort in London Has Uncertain Architect 

A casino resort being built in the east side of London has some people scratching their heads as to who is behind the design. Local officials were expecting a proposal from a well-known and experienced casino company, but instead they received one from an unknown architectural firm.

The plans for the casino are very extravagant, with a large central tower that dominates the surrounding area. However, many residents are worried that the resort will not be able to generate enough business to be profitable, and that it will end up becoming a white elephant.

There has been no comment from the architectural firm about their involvement in the project, and local officials say that they have no idea who they are. The only thing that is known about them is that they have no previous experience in designing casinos.

#  Who is the Architect of the Casino Resort in Sherlock Holmes' London? 

In the Sherlock Holmes stories, the fictional detective is often consulted about legal matters by his friend and associate, Dr. John Watson. In one story, "The Adventure of the Six Napoleons", Holmes is asked to investigate the theft of a number of valuable coins from a London casino. The affable Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard collaborates on the case with Holmes. 

In the story, Holmes is able to quickly determine that the thief was not an amateur but a professional who had planned and executed the robbery deliberately. He also deduces that the thief must be an expert in casinos, since he or she was able to avoid detection by security cameras and staff. 

Given these facts, it is natural to ask: Who was the architect of the casino resort in Sherlock Holmes' London? This question has yet to be definitively answered, but several candidates have been suggested over the years. 

One possible candidate is American casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. Adelson is well-known for his lavish casino resorts, and he has been known to make generous donations to political campaigns. In 2012, he donated $5 million to Restore Our Future, a pro-Mitt Romney Super PAC. 

Another possible candidate is Malaysian gambling tycoon Lim Kok Thay. Lim Kok Thay is the chairman and CEO of Genting Group, one of the largest casino companies in the world. Genting Group owns several high-profile casinos resorts around the world, including Resorts World Sentosa in Singapore and Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut. 

It's still not clear who exactly was responsible for designing Sherlock Holmes' fictional casino resort, but it's safe to say that it would have been a highly experienced and successful casino architect!

#  Uncertainty Surrounds Role of Architect in London Casino Resort

Planning permission for the £2bn London casino resort was granted in May of this year, but with uncertainty surrounding the role of the architect in the project. 

The architect, EPR Architects, withdrew from the project in late September, and the developer, Asian Coast Development Ltd (ACDL), is now looking for a replacement. The project is said to be around 70% complete, so it is essential that a new architect is found quickly to avoid any further delays.

A spokesperson for ACDL said: “EPR’s departure will not affect the overall development schedule or budget of the project. We remain on track to open in 2020 and are working with our delivery partners to ensure a smooth transition.”

It is not clear why EPR Architects withdrew from the project, but it is thought that there may have been disagreements over design and construction issues.

The London casino resort is set to be one of the biggest in Europe, with 1,500 gaming tables and 5,000 slot machines. It will also include a luxury hotel, spa, restaurants and bars.

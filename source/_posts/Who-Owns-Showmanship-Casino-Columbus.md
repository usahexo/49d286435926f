#  Who Owns Showmanship Casino Columbus?

The ownership of Showmanship Casino Columbus is up for debate. The casino is owned by the Culver family, who are also the owners of the Columbus Blue Jackets. But some people believe that the casino should be owned by the city of Columbus.

There are a few reasons why people believe that the city should own the casino. First, the casino brings in a lot of revenue for the city. In fact, it's one of the biggest sources of revenue for Columbus. Second, the casino was built with public money. The Culver family used $78 million in taxpayer money to build the casino. Finally, many people believe that the casino was built to benefit the Culver family, not Columbus residents.

The Culver family has argued that they have contributed a lot to Columbus and that they deserve to own the casino. They've also said that they would be willing to sell the casino to the city if they were offered a fair price.

So who really owns Showmanship Casino Columbus? That's a question that may never be answered for sure. But it's clear that the Culver family wields a lot of power in this situation and that they're not likely to give up their ownership of the casino without a fight.

#  Red Hot Poker Plant Owner Sues Casino

A red hot poker plant owner is suing a casino after she was injured when a pot of the plants toppled over and spilled onto her.

The woman, who has not been identified, alleges that the pot of plants was negligently placed next to a heat vent in the casino, which caused it to become extremely hot and topple over, spilling scalding water onto her feet.

She is seeking damages for the injuries she sustained in the accident, which included second-degree burns to her feet.

Red hot poker plants are a type of flowering plant that is widely grown as an ornamental garden plant. The plants grow from rhizomes and can reach heights of up to three feet tall. They produce bright red tubular flowers that are often used in flower arrangements.

The plants are not typically considered dangerous, but can be dangerous if they are mishandled or if they come into contact with skin that has been damaged by sunburn or a previous burn.

#  Casino Says Showmanship Plant Owner Owes Them Money

The management of a casino in the northern part of the state has filed a civil suit against the owner of a nearby horticultural center, alleging that the center's owner agreed to help promote the casino but has not done so.

The suit, filed earlier this week in state superior court, seeks repayment of more than $200,000 in promised marketing and advertising support from the horticultural center's owner.

According to the lawsuit, casino officials met with the horticultural center's owner last year and struck an agreement under which the center would provide at least $10,000 worth of advertising and marketing support for the casino. In exchange, the casino would prominently display the horticultural center's logo at its facilities and refer potential customers to it.

But casino officials say that while they have received some advertising from the horticultural center, it has not been consistent or adequate. They also claim that the horticultural center's owner has not referred any potential customers to them.

#  Plant Owner Claims Casino Took Advantage of Him

A plant owner from Massachusetts who wishes to remain anonymous is suing the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe for what he calls "exploitation." The plant owner has claimed that the casino took advantage of his weakened state and used his vulnerability to pressure him into signing a deal that was unfavorable to him.

The plant owner became involved with the casino after he was diagnosed with cancer. He stated that he was desperate for money at the time and the casino took advantage of that. They pressured him into signing a memorandum of understanding which gave them exclusive rights to negotiate a gaming compact with the state.

The plant owner is now asking the court to invalidate the agreement, arguing that he was coerced into signing it. He also claims that the tribe never intended to follow through with their promises.

The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe has issued a statement denying all of the allegations made by the plant owner. They maintain that they had always intended to honor their commitments and that the agreement was reached in good faith.

This case could set an important precedent for future dealings between tribes and businesses. If the plant owner is successful in getting the agreement overturned, it could make it more difficult for casinos to take advantage of vulnerable individuals.

#  Showdown Over Who Owns The Showmanship Casino Columbus Red Hot Poker Plant

There’s a legal dispute brewing in the Showmanship Casino Columbus over who actually owns the Red Hot Poker plant.

The casino’s management insists that they own the plant, while the union representing the casino’s workers contends that the workers are the rightful owners.

The disagreement began last month, when the casino’s management installed a new security system that requires all employees to scan their ID cards before entering the building.

The casino’s management said that they installed the system in order to prevent workers from bringing in unauthorized items, such as food or plants.

However, the union said that the new system is really just a way for the casino’s management to keep track of which employees are involved in the union organizing effort.

In response to the new security system, the union organized a protest outside of the casino.

The protesters carried signs that read “Showmanship Casino Columbus: The Workers Own The Plant” and “We Will Not Be Silenced.”

The protest attracted a lot of media attention, and it even caught the attention of Ohio Governor John Kasich.

Governor Kasich said that he was “disappointed” by the way that casino’s management was treating its workers and he urged both sides to sit down and resolve their differences.

So far, however, there has been no resolution and both sides remain deadlocked.

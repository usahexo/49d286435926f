#  What is the objective of the game?

The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible before the time runs out. Players can score points by hitting the ball into one of the six rings, with different point values awarded for different ring locations. The game ends when either time runs out or the ball goes out of bounds.

# How do you play?

To play, each player stands at a end of the court with a ball. One player throws the ball high into the air and attempts to hit it into the other player’s side of the court. If they miss, the other player can try to hit the ball back, and so on. The goal is to keep possession of the ball and hit it into one of your opponent’s rings. If you are successful, your opponent then has to get the ball back and throw it back to you. If you lose possession of the ball or it goes out of bounds, your opponent gets a point.




A match is typically played to 11 points, but can be extended up to 21 points if both players agree beforehand.

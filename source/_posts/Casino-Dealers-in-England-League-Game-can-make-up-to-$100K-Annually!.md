#  Casino Dealers in England League Game can make up to $100K Annually!

Casino dealers in England can make up to $100,000 annually, new data suggests.

The average wage for a casino dealer in the UK is around £21,600 (US$27,700), according to research by jobs site Glassdoor. But the top 10% of earners take home an average salary of £45,000 (US$58,800), while the top 1% boast an annual income of £75,000 (US$97,800).

The news will come as music to the ears of those working in casinos across the country – and could rival the wages on offer in other high-paying industries such as finance or law.

So what exactly puts casino dealers in pole position when it comes to earning potential? It’s all down to tips from players.

“It’s no secret that casino dealers can make a lot of money from tips, especially if they work in a high-roller room or for a VIP table,” says careers expert Lynn Taylor. “But even those who work on regular tables can earn a healthy salary from gratuities. In fact, many casinos have policies that state dealers must be tipped for providing good service.”

And it’s not just those at the top of the pay scale who benefit from generous tipping. Casino floor staff – such as croupiers, pit bosses and supervisors – can also make supplementary income from gratuities on top of their basic salary.

So if you’re looking for a well-paid job with good tips, a career as a casino dealer could be just the thing for you.

#  Casino Dealers rake in over $50,000 in tips during a season!

While some casino dealers may start out with a salary as low as $25,000 per year, they can make much more in tips. In fact, many dealers take home more than $50,000 during a season.

The amount of tips a dealer takes in depends on a number of factors, including the type of casino, the size of the casino, and the number of players at the table. However, most dealers report taking home an average of $20-$30 per hour in tips.

There are a few things that you can do to ensure that you leave your dealer with a bountiful tip. First, be sure to observe proper etiquette at the table. Don't talk loudly or blow on your cards. Second, try to tip consistent amounts for each hand. Finally, be generous when it comes to tipping big jackpot winners.

If you're looking for a way to show your appreciation for a job well done, tipping your dealer is a great way to do it!

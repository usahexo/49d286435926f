#  Spurs Make a Strong Case in the Rake Race

The Spurs are one of the NBA’s most successful teams in recent memory, making it to the playoffs for 21 straight years. This season they look poised to break through and make a run at the Finals. One of the reasons they’re so successful is their ability to play as a team.

As with any team sport, chemistry is key. And the Spurs have that in spades.

This was on display during a game against the Golden State Warriors in February. The Warriors were up by 5 points with just over 2 minutes left in the game. But the Spurs weren’t done yet. They rallied back and tied the game with seconds left on the clock. Then they went on to win in overtime.

That kind of resilience is a testament to how close this team is. They never give up, no matter what the situation is.

And their chemistry isn’t just reserved for crunch time moments either. It extends to off-the-court activities too. For example, earlier this year Manu Ginobili hosted an event called “Hoops and Hugs” which brought together current and former Spurs players for a day of fun and charity work.

This event is just another example of how tight knit this team really is. They do things not just for themselves, but for each other as well. And that’s a big reason why they continue to be successful year after year.

#  Spurs Come Up Short in Poker rake Race

The poker world is eagerly watching the competition between PokerStars and 888Poker to become the top poker site. In the latest bidding war, the two companies are vying for a new market: Spanish players.

888Poker just announced it will offer rake-free games to Spanish players in an effort to lure them away from PokerStars. This comes after PokerStars announced it will increase its rake in Spain by 10%.

Spanish players generate a lot of revenue for online poker sites. In 2015, they accounted for $108 million in rake, making them the second-biggest market behind the United States.

888Poker currently has a slight lead over PokerStars in Spain, but PokerStars is still the dominant player in the country. The company has more than 2 million Spanish players, compared to 888Poker’s 600,000.

888Poker is hoping its new rake-free offer will give it the edge it needs to catch up to PokerStars. The company is also offering sign-up bonuses of up to €1,000 for new players.

It’s unclear how this new offer will impact the Spanish market. It could start a price war between the two companies, driving down profits for both of them. Or it could prompt more Spanish players to switch to 888Poker, giving them a significant advantage over PokerStars.

Time will tell who wins this battle for Spanish players. In the meantime, both companies are likely to continue increasing their rake in order to gain an edge over their competitors.

#  How Much Does Casino Rake Affect Your Winnings?

Casinos have what is called a rake, which is the percentage of each bet that the house takes. This percentage can vary from casino to casino, and even game to game. In some games, the rake can be as little as 2 percent, while in others it can be as high as 10 percent or more. So how does this percentage affect your bottom line?

To answer that question, we need to take a look at the math behind it. Let's say you're playing a game where the rake is 5 percent. For every $100 you bet, the house takes $5, leaving you with $95. Now let's assume you're betting against a 50/50 odds game- in other words, you have a 50 percent chance of winning each time you make a bet. If you make 10 bets in a row, your expected value (EV) would be $0 since EV is just the average amount of money you'll win or lose on each bet. However, because of the rake, you'd actually end up losing $5 in the long run- meaning that casino has effectively seized 5 percent of your bankroll.

In games with lower rakes, like blackjack or craps, the impact of the house edge is less pronounced. However, in games with higher rakes like slots or video poker, that 5 percent can really start to eat away at your profits. So before you sit down at your next casino table, be sure to check out the rake and make sure it's something you're comfortable with- after all, there's no point in playing if the casino is going to take more than your expected return!

#  Do Poker Players Have to Pay Casino Rake?

Casino rake is the money that the casino charges the poker players for playing in the casino. Poker rooms usually take 5% of each pot, but the percentage can vary depending on the room and the game. This article discusses whether or not poker players have to pay casino rake.

Traditionally, casino rake has been seen as a necessary expense in order to keep the poker games running. However, this view is changing as more and more poker rooms offer no-rake games. In fact, some rooms are now even offering rake-free tournaments.

So does this mean that poker players no longer have to pay casino rake? The answer is no - at least, not yet. While some rooms are experimenting with no-rake games, the vast majority of rooms still charge a rake. And until this changes, poker players will need to continue paying casino rake.

#  What is Casino Rake and How Does it Affect My Winnings?

Casino rake is defined as a commission that the house takes on each hand of poker. It’s essentially the price of playing at a casino and is collected by the dealer. The rake goes towards compensating the casino for its expenses in hosting the game, as well as incentivizing house players to compete against those sitting at the table.

The percentage taken from each pot depends on the stakes of the game, but typically falls between 2% and 5%. This means that for every $100 wagered in a hand, the house would take between $2 and $5. In some cases, particularly high-stakes games, the rake can be even higher.

There are also variations on how rake is collected – it can either be taken before or after each hand depending on the casino. However, most casinos use post-rake methods, which means that players have to pay their rake before they leave the table.

For players, casino rake can have a significant impact on their overall winnings. In addition to eating into your potential profits, it also reduces your chance of winning since you’re basically playing against an opponent who has an advantage (the house). This is why it’s important to always factor in rake when deciding whether or not to play a particular game.

In spite of this, however, poker remains one of the most popular casino games around thanks to its exciting action and potential for big wins. With careful bankroll management and a bit of luck, you could very well come out ahead in the end.

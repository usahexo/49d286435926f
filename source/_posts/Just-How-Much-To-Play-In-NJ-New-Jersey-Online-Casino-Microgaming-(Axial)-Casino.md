#  Just How Much To Play In NJ-New Jersey Online Casino Microgaming (Axial) Casino?

The Garden State's legalized online gambling industry is up and running, but there's still plenty of questions as to what the future looks like. One of the most pressing questions lies in just how much New Jersey residents are allowed to play at a single NJ-licensed online casino.

The answer is a bit complicated, as it depends on what type of casino game you're playing. But generally speaking, players are allowed to wager $10 per round at blackjack and other table games, and $5 per bet at slots and other video poker games.

Again, these limits vary depending on the game being played, so please consult the specific rules for that game before placing any bets.

It's also important to note that these maximum bets only apply to money that's been deposited into your account at the NJ-licensed casino; any winnings from free trials or bonus offers are exempt from these limits.

So far, it looks like New Jersey's online casino industry is off to a strong start. In its first month of operation, online casinos generated over $3 million in revenue, with over half of that coming from slots play.

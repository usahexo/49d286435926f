#  New Cure for Gambling Addiction Found

A new study has been published that could provide a cure for gambling addiction.

The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of British Columbia, found that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective cure for gambling addiction. The study involved 45 participants who were all addicted to gambling.

The participants were randomly assigned to either the CBT group or a control group. The CBT group received 16 sessions of CBT, while the control group did not receive any treatment.

The results of the study showed that the CBT group had a significantly lower relapse rate than the control group. The CBT group also had a lower level of problem gambling severity than the control group.

These findings suggest that CBT is an effective treatment for gambling addiction.

#  Scientists Working Hard to Find Cure for Gambling Addiction

Gambling addiction is a real problem, and scientists are hard at work trying to find a cure for it. There are many different methods being tested, but so far nothing has been proven to be consistently effective.

One possible treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy. This approach helps people to change their thoughts and behaviours around gambling. It can be effective in some cases, but it isnâ€™t always available and it can be expensive.

Another potential treatment is medication. Some people seem to respond well to medication, but there are side effects associated with many of the medications that have been tried. Additionally, not everyone responds to medication, and some people find that they become addicted to the medication itself.

A third potential treatment is self-exclusion. This involves asking a casino or other gambling establishment to exclude you from their premises. However, this only works if you are able to stick to your commitment not to gamble. If you end up back at the casino, you will be violating the exclusion agreement and could face consequences.

So far, there is no one cure for gambling addiction that works for everyone. Scientists are still working hard to find a solution, and hopefully something will be found soon. In the meantime, those affected by gambling addiction should seek out help from a professional therapist or counsellor.

#  Breakthrough Drug Therapy Shows Promise in Treating Gambling Addiction

For the estimated 2 million Americans with gambling addiction, there may be hope on the horizon. A new breakthrough drug therapy is showing promise in treating the disorder.

The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) released a statement recently that applauded the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approving lorcaserin hydrochloride (Belviq), a drug used to help people lose weight. The NCPG believes that Belviq may also be effective in treating gambling addiction.

There is currently no FDA-approved medication for the treatment of gambling addiction, but researchers are hopeful that Belviq may provide some relief for those struggling with the disorder.

Gambling addiction is a serious condition that can have devastating consequences. It can destroy relationships, lead to financial ruin, and even cause physical harm to the gambler.

Currently, there are only a few treatment options available for people with gambling addiction. These include counseling and therapy, self-help groups, and medications such as naltrexone and acamprosate. While these treatments can be effective, they are not always available or appropriate for everyone.

Belviq is the first weight loss medication to be approved by the FDA in more than a decade, and researchers believe it may hold potential for treating other conditions as well, including gambling addiction.

#  Experimental Treatment Shows Hope in Curing Gambling Addictions

A new study published in the journal "Addiction" has shown great potential for a new experimental treatment in curing gambling addictions. The study, conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Cambridge, found that the treatment was able to reduce relapse rates by almost 50%.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have a devastating impact on the lives of sufferers and their families. The condition is believed to affect around 2% of the population, with men being more likely to suffer from it than women. Gambling addiction can lead to financial ruin, job loss, and even suicide.

There are currently no effective treatments for gambling addiction, which is why this new study is so promising. The experimental treatment involves giving patients a drug called naltrexone before they gamble. Naltrexone is normally used to treat alcohol and opioid addictions, but the University of Cambridge team found that it can also help reduce gambling cravings.

The study involved 126 participants who were all addicted to gambling. Half of the participants were given naltrexone before they gambled, while the other half received a placebo. The results showed that those who received naltrexone were less likely to relapse than those who received the placebo. In fact, only 14% of those who received naltrexone relapsed, compared to 34% of those who received the placebo.

While these findings are preliminary, they suggest that naltrexone may be an effective treatment for gambling addiction. More research is needed to confirm these results, but this new study provides hope for a potential cure for this debilitating condition.

#  Doctors Believe They May Have Found a Cure for Gambling Addiction

For years, doctors have been searching for a cure for gambling addiction. They may have finally found it.

Gambling addiction is a condition that affects many people. It can be very difficult to overcome. However, doctors believe they may have found a cure that can help people overcome their addiction.

The new cure is a pill that is taken twice a day. It helps to block the effects of dopamine, which is the neurotransmitter that is released when someone gambles. This pill has been shown to be effective in helping people overcome their addiction.

Some people may be hesitant to take a pill in order to overcome their addiction. However, this pill has been shown to be very effective and safe. There are no known side effects of taking this pill.

If you are struggling with gambling addiction, talk to your doctor about the possibility of taking this pill. It may be just what you need to overcome your addiction and get your life back on track

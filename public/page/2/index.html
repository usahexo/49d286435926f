        <h1 id="NJ-becomes-first-state-to-legalize-sports-gambling"><a href="#NJ-becomes-first-state-to-legalize-sports-gambling" class="headerlink" title="NJ becomes first state to legalize sports gambling"></a>NJ becomes first state to legalize sports gambling</h1><p>On Monday, New Jersey became the first state in the United States to legalize sports gambling, overturning a ban that has been in place for more than two decades. The landmark ruling was made by the US Supreme Court, which voted 6-3 in favor of New Jersey.</p>
<p>Governor Phil Murphy hailed the decision as a victory for the people of New Jersey, who have been pushing for legalization for years. “This is a great day for the rights of states and their people to make their own decisions,” he said.</p>
<p>Sports bettors in the state are already celebrating, and many are eager to get their hands on those all-important betting slips. “I’ve been waiting for this day for years,” said one regular gambler. “I can’t wait to start betting on sports.”</p>
<p>Not everyone is happy with the decision, however, with some arguing that it will lead to addiction and other social problems. But Governor Murphy is confident that New Jersey can handle legalized sports gambling responsibly.</p>
<p>“We have put in place strong consumer protections,” he said. “And we are prepared to deal with any potential negative consequences.”</p>
<p>The legalization of sports gambling is a major victory for Governor Murphy and his new administration. It’s also a win for the people of New Jersey, who can now enjoy this popular pastime without having to break the law.</p>
<h1 id="Supreme-Court-strikes-down-federal-ban-on-sports-gambling"><a href="#Supreme-Court-strikes-down-federal-ban-on-sports-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Supreme Court strikes down federal ban on sports gambling"></a>Supreme Court strikes down federal ban on sports gambling</h1><p>The United States Supreme Court has struck down a law prohibiting most states from legalizing sports gambling, in a landmark decision that could lead to a nationwide overhaul of the country’s tightly-regulated betting industry.</p>
<p>In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) unconstitutional because it violated the principle of state’s rights. The law had effectively banned legal sports betting with the exception of Nevada.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito, who delivered the opinion of the court, said that PASPA “unequivocally dictates what states may and may not do.” He added that the law “violates the anti-commandeering doctrine” by preventing states from making their own decisions about whether to allow gambling within their borders.</p>
<p>The ruling is a major victory for those who have long argued that sports gambling should be legalized and regulated as a means of generating new revenue for cash-strapped states and casinos. It also represents a major defeat for the NFL, NBA, MLB and other professional sports leagues, which had lobbied hard against legalization.</p>
<p>The fallout from Monday’s ruling is likely to be far-reaching, with experts predicting that individual states will now move quickly to legalize various forms of sports betting. Delaware, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington have already taken steps to do so in anticipation of Monday’s ruling.</p>
<p>Nevada is expected to be one of the biggest winners in Monday’s ruling, as it will now become the only state where people can bet on single games. The state’s gaming industry is worth an estimated $250 billion and employs over 150,000 people.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-becomes-second-state-to-legalize-sports-gambling"><a href="#Delaware-becomes-second-state-to-legalize-sports-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware becomes second state to legalize sports gambling"></a>Delaware becomes second state to legalize sports gambling</h1><p>On Tuesday, the Delaware state Senate voted 12-9 to legalize sports gambling in the state. This makes Delaware the second state in the US to legalize sports gambling, after New Jersey.</p>
<p>Governor John Carney is expected to sign the bill into law, which would then allow casinos and racetracks in Delaware to offer betting on professional and college sports. The bill allows bets to be placed both online and at physical locations.</p>
<p>Sports gambling is a popular pastime across the US, with an estimated $150 billion wagered each year. However, it has only been legal in a handful of states.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalized sports gambling argue that it will bring much-needed revenue to state governments. They also point out that it can help keep people from placing illegal bets, and that it can be used to track betting patterns in order to detect potential match-fixing.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and financial ruin for players and fans. They also say that it can damage the integrity of sporting events.</p>
<p>Delaware is not the only state considering legalizing sports gambling. A bill is currently pending in the New York state Assembly, and there is also legalization legislation pending in Michigan, Rhode Island, and West Virginia.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-becomes-third-state-to-legalize-sports-gambling"><a href="#Pennsylvania-becomes-third-state-to-legalize-sports-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania becomes third state to legalize sports gambling"></a>Pennsylvania becomes third state to legalize sports gambling</h1><p>On Tuesday, May 15, 2018, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives voted 102-71 in favor of legalizing sports betting within the state. This makes Pennsylvania the third state in the nation to offer legalized sports gambling, after New Jersey and Delaware.</p>
<p>The new law allows casinos in the state to take bets on sporting events, with wagers being placed both in person and online. Bettors will have to be at least 21 years old, and the minimum age for participation in online sports gambling will be 18. It is still unclear how much tax revenue the new law will generate for the state government, but it is estimated that it could bring in as much as $100 million annually.</p>
<p>This is a major victory for casino owners and lawmakers in Pennsylvania, who have been pushing for legalized sports gambling for years. They see it as a way to help struggling casinos stay afloat, while also bringing in much-needed tax revenue.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports gambling say that it will lead to more gambling addiction and other social problems. But supporters argue that it is already happening illegally and that legalization will allow the government to regulate and tax it.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how this new law will play out in Pennsylvania, but it is another sign that legalized sports betting is becoming more mainstream across the country.</p>
<h1 id="More-states-expected-to-legalize-sports-gambling-in-wake-of-Supreme-Court-ruling"><a href="#More-states-expected-to-legalize-sports-gambling-in-wake-of-Supreme-Court-ruling" class="headerlink" title="More states expected to legalize sports gambling in wake of Supreme Court ruling"></a>More states expected to legalize sports gambling in wake of Supreme Court ruling</h1><p>Earlier in the year, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear a case that would determine the legality of sports gambling across the country. The decision came in May 2018, with the Supreme Court ruling in favor of legalizing sports gambling, striking down a federal law that prohibited most states from allowing betting on sporting events.</p>
<p>Since the ruling, multiple states have announced plans to legalize sports gambling. Delaware became the first state to take advantage of the ruling, launching its sports betting app on June 5. Rhode Island plans to have its own sports betting app ready by August. Mississippi and West Virginia are also expected to launch their own sports betting apps relatively soon.</p>
<p>Other states are also considering legalizing sports gambling. New York is one such state; lawmakers there are currently debating a bill that would allow wagers on both professional and collegiate sporting events. If passed, New York would become one of the largest states for legal sports gambling.</p>
<p>What Does This Mean for Gamblers?</p>
<p>The legalization of sports gambling means that gamblers now have more options when it comes to placing bets on sporting events. In addition to traditional methods such as bookmakers and offshore sites, gamblers can now place bets through state-run apps and websites. This could lead to increased profits for casinos and other businesses that offer sports betting services.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that this ruling does not affect daily fantasy sports (DFS). DFS is still considered a game of skill, and as such is not subject to federal or state laws regarding gambling. However, some states have introduced legislation that would prohibit DFS games offered by companies like FanDuel and DraftKings.</p>
<p>What Does This Mean for Sports?</p>
<p>The legalization of sports gambling will likely have a negative impact on professional and collegiate sports organizations. Bettors no longer need to risk illegal activities (such as paying someone to fix a game) in order to place bets on sporting events; they can now do so through legal means such as state-run websites and apps. This could lead to an increase in match fixing and other forms of cheating.</p>
<p>It is also possible that legalized sports gambling will increase the amount of money spent on betting pools for major sporting events such as the Super Bowl or the World Cup. This could lead to decreased profits for teams and athletes, as well as for broadcasters and other businesses that rely on advertising revenue from major sporting events.</p>

        <h1 id="Seven-Methods-to-Play-Casino-Games-Online"><a href="#Seven-Methods-to-Play-Casino-Games-Online" class="headerlink" title="Seven Methods to Play Casino Games Online"></a>Seven Methods to Play Casino Games Online</h1><p>Casino games have always been a popular pastime, both in brick-and-mortar establishments and at home. In the last decade or so, however, online casino gaming has become an increasingly popular way to play these games. Thanks to advancements in technology, players can now choose to enjoy their favourite casino games from the comfort of their own homes, without having to leave their couch. There are a number of different ways that people can access online casino games; in this article we will take a look at seven of them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Via an Online Casino Website</li>
</ol>
<p>The most common way for people to access online casino games is via websites that offer them. Generally speaking, these websites will require you to create an account and then download their software client in order to play the games. Once you have installed the software, you will be able to log in and start playing.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Via an Online Casino App</li>
</ol>
<p>A growing number of online casinos are also offering apps that can be downloaded onto mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. These apps generally offer a slightly different experience than the website versions, as they are designed specifically for mobile devices. They often include touchscreen functionality and other features that make them more suitable for gameplay on the go.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Via a Traditional Online Casino Client</li>
</ol>
<p>Many people still prefer to access online casino games via traditional “download” clients. These clients install on your computer just like any other program, and give you direct access to the games without having to visit a website or use an app. They often have better graphics and performance than web-based versions, making them appealing to some players.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Via an Instant Play Casino Website or App</li>
</ol>
<p>Another option for accessing casino games is through instant play casinos. These platforms allow you to play the games directly in your web browser without having to download any software or register for an account. This is ideal for players who want quick and easy access to their favourite games without having to go through any extra hassle. Some instant play casinos also offer apps which provide even more convenience.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Via a Mobile Browser Website or App</li>
</ol>
<p>A newer development in the world of online casinos is mobile browser gaming websites and apps. These platforms allow players to gamble on their mobile devices by using their device’s native web browser (Safari on iOS devices, Chrome on Android devices, etc). This offers a level of convenience not found with other options, as there is no need to download any additional software or apps – you can simply open up your browser and start playing right away!</p>
<p> 6 .Via Social Media Websites&#x2F;Apps</p>
<h1 id="Why-Play-Online-Casino"><a href="#Why-Play-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Why Play Online Casino?"></a>Why Play Online Casino?</h1><p>Playing casino games online has become a huge pastime for people all around the world. In fact, in some countries, such as the United States, playing casino games online is more popular than playing at a physical casino. And there are good reasons for this – online casinos offer players convenience, bonuses, and opportunities to win that simply aren’t available at traditional casinos.</p>
<p>The first reason why so many people prefer to play casino games online is convenience. With the click of a mouse, players can access any number of top-rated online casinos, browse through any number of games, and make a deposit in minutes. Contrast this with having to drive to a physical casino, find parking, walk through the casino floor to your favorite game, and then hope that there’s a seat available. It’s no wonder that so many people choose the convenience of online casinos!</p>
<p>Another big advantage of playing casino games online is the abundance of bonuses offered to players. Online casinos love getting new players through their doors and will oftentimes shower them with sign-up bonuses, deposit bonuses, free spins, and more. This means that players can potentially increase their bankrolls quite a bit just by playing at an online casino!</p>
<p>Finally, one of the biggest advantages of playing casino games online is the opportunity to win real money jackpots. Many traditional land-based casinos don’t have jackpot slots or progressive jackpot games – but almost every online casino does. This means that players have a much better chance of winning life-changing amounts of money by playing at an online casino!</p>
<h1 id="How-Do-I-Get-Started-Playing-Casino-Games-Online"><a href="#How-Do-I-Get-Started-Playing-Casino-Games-Online" class="headerlink" title="How Do I Get Started Playing Casino Games Online?"></a>How Do I Get Started Playing Casino Games Online?</h1><p>If you’re looking to start playing casino games online, you may be wondering where to start. With so many different options available, it can be tricky to know where to begin. Here, we’ll take a look at the basics of getting started in online casinos, and give you a few tips on how to get the most out of your experience.</p>
<p>The first step is to find a reputable online casino. There are many different options out there, so it’s important to do your research and find one that’s trustworthy. Once you’ve found a good casino, create an account and fund it with some money. This will allow you to start playing casino games for real money.</p>
<p>There are many different games available at online casinos, but the most popular by far are slots. There are hundreds of different slot games available, so you’re sure to find one that suits your taste. The great thing about slots is that they’re easy to play and don’t require any skill or knowledge. Simply choose a game, place your bet and hit the spin button!</p>
<p>If slots aren’t your thing, don’t worry – there are plenty of other games available too. Roulette, blackjack and poker are all popular choices, and each game has its own rules and strategies that you can learn about if you want to improve your chances of winning.</p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen a game to play, it’s important to familiarise yourself with the rules. Most online casinos have detailed instructions on how each game works, as well as strategy advice for beginners. Be sure to read these guides before playing, as they can help you make better decisions and increase your chances of winning.</p>
<p>Finally, remember to have fun! Online casinos can be a lot of fun, and there’s nothing wrong with enjoying a few spins or hands while you relax in front of your computer screen. So sit back, relax and enjoy the excitement of gambling online!</p>
<h1 id="Benefits-of-Playing-in-an-Online-Casino"><a href="#Benefits-of-Playing-in-an-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of Playing in an Online Casino"></a>Benefits of Playing in an Online Casino</h1><p>There are plenty of reasons why you might want to play casino games online, instead of in a traditional brick-and-mortar casino. For one thing, online casinos often have more games to choose from than traditional casinos. You can also find games at online casinos that you won’t find at brick-and-mortar casinos, such as unique variations of popular casino games like blackjack and roulette.</p>
<p>Online casinos also offer better odds than traditional casinos. This is because there is no need for the casino to make up for the costs associated with running a physical building. Additionally, many online casinos offer generous bonuses, which can give you a significant edge over the house.</p>
<p>Another great benefit of playing casino games online is that you can often play for free. This allows you to practice before playing for real money. It also gives you a chance to explore different games and strategies without risking any of your hard-earned cash.</p>
<p>Finally, online casinos are open 24&#x2F;7, which means that you can play whenever it’s convenient for you. This is a major advantage over traditional casinos, which typically have shorter hours.</p>
<h1 id="The-Top-Ten-Reasons-to-Play-at-an-Online-Casino"><a href="#The-Top-Ten-Reasons-to-Play-at-an-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="The Top Ten Reasons to Play at an Online Casino"></a>The Top Ten Reasons to Play at an Online Casino</h1><p>People have different reasons for gambling. Some people do it for the thrill of winning money, while others enjoy the social aspect of gaming. Whatever the reason, online casinos offer a variety of benefits that traditional casinos don’t.</p>

        <h1 id="Spurs-Make-a-Strong-Case-in-the-Rake-Race"><a href="#Spurs-Make-a-Strong-Case-in-the-Rake-Race" class="headerlink" title="Spurs Make a Strong Case in the Rake Race"></a>Spurs Make a Strong Case in the Rake Race</h1><p>The Spurs are one of the NBA’s most successful teams in recent memory, making it to the playoffs for 21 straight years. This season they look poised to break through and make a run at the Finals. One of the reasons they’re so successful is their ability to play as a team.</p>
<p>As with any team sport, chemistry is key. And the Spurs have that in spades.</p>
<p>This was on display during a game against the Golden State Warriors in February. The Warriors were up by 5 points with just over 2 minutes left in the game. But the Spurs weren’t done yet. They rallied back and tied the game with seconds left on the clock. Then they went on to win in overtime.</p>
<p>That kind of resilience is a testament to how close this team is. They never give up, no matter what the situation is.</p>
<p>And their chemistry isn’t just reserved for crunch time moments either. It extends to off-the-court activities too. For example, earlier this year Manu Ginobili hosted an event called “Hoops and Hugs” which brought together current and former Spurs players for a day of fun and charity work.</p>
<p>This event is just another example of how tight knit this team really is. They do things not just for themselves, but for each other as well. And that’s a big reason why they continue to be successful year after year.</p>
<h1 id="Spurs-Come-Up-Short-in-Poker-rake-Race"><a href="#Spurs-Come-Up-Short-in-Poker-rake-Race" class="headerlink" title="Spurs Come Up Short in Poker rake Race"></a>Spurs Come Up Short in Poker rake Race</h1><p>The poker world is eagerly watching the competition between PokerStars and 888Poker to become the top poker site. In the latest bidding war, the two companies are vying for a new market: Spanish players.</p>
<p>888Poker just announced it will offer rake-free games to Spanish players in an effort to lure them away from PokerStars. This comes after PokerStars announced it will increase its rake in Spain by 10%.</p>
<p>Spanish players generate a lot of revenue for online poker sites. In 2015, they accounted for $108 million in rake, making them the second-biggest market behind the United States.</p>
<p>888Poker currently has a slight lead over PokerStars in Spain, but PokerStars is still the dominant player in the country. The company has more than 2 million Spanish players, compared to 888Poker’s 600,000.</p>
<p>888Poker is hoping its new rake-free offer will give it the edge it needs to catch up to PokerStars. The company is also offering sign-up bonuses of up to €1,000 for new players.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how this new offer will impact the Spanish market. It could start a price war between the two companies, driving down profits for both of them. Or it could prompt more Spanish players to switch to 888Poker, giving them a significant advantage over PokerStars.</p>
<p>Time will tell who wins this battle for Spanish players. In the meantime, both companies are likely to continue increasing their rake in order to gain an edge over their competitors.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Does-Casino-Rake-Affect-Your-Winnings"><a href="#How-Much-Does-Casino-Rake-Affect-Your-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="How Much Does Casino Rake Affect Your Winnings?"></a>How Much Does Casino Rake Affect Your Winnings?</h1><p>Casinos have what is called a rake, which is the percentage of each bet that the house takes. This percentage can vary from casino to casino, and even game to game. In some games, the rake can be as little as 2 percent, while in others it can be as high as 10 percent or more. So how does this percentage affect your bottom line?</p>
<p>To answer that question, we need to take a look at the math behind it. Let’s say you’re playing a game where the rake is 5 percent. For every $100 you bet, the house takes $5, leaving you with $95. Now let’s assume you’re betting against a 50&#x2F;50 odds game- in other words, you have a 50 percent chance of winning each time you make a bet. If you make 10 bets in a row, your expected value (EV) would be $0 since EV is just the average amount of money you’ll win or lose on each bet. However, because of the rake, you’d actually end up losing $5 in the long run- meaning that casino has effectively seized 5 percent of your bankroll.</p>
<p>In games with lower rakes, like blackjack or craps, the impact of the house edge is less pronounced. However, in games with higher rakes like slots or video poker, that 5 percent can really start to eat away at your profits. So before you sit down at your next casino table, be sure to check out the rake and make sure it’s something you’re comfortable with- after all, there’s no point in playing if the casino is going to take more than your expected return!</p>
<h1 id="Do-Poker-Players-Have-to-Pay-Casino-Rake"><a href="#Do-Poker-Players-Have-to-Pay-Casino-Rake" class="headerlink" title="Do Poker Players Have to Pay Casino Rake?"></a>Do Poker Players Have to Pay Casino Rake?</h1><p>Casino rake is the money that the casino charges the poker players for playing in the casino. Poker rooms usually take 5% of each pot, but the percentage can vary depending on the room and the game. This article discusses whether or not poker players have to pay casino rake.</p>
<p>Traditionally, casino rake has been seen as a necessary expense in order to keep the poker games running. However, this view is changing as more and more poker rooms offer no-rake games. In fact, some rooms are now even offering rake-free tournaments.</p>
<p>So does this mean that poker players no longer have to pay casino rake? The answer is no - at least, not yet. While some rooms are experimenting with no-rake games, the vast majority of rooms still charge a rake. And until this changes, poker players will need to continue paying casino rake.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-Casino-Rake-and-How-Does-it-Affect-My-Winnings"><a href="#What-is-Casino-Rake-and-How-Does-it-Affect-My-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="What is Casino Rake and How Does it Affect My Winnings?"></a>What is Casino Rake and How Does it Affect My Winnings?</h1><p>Casino rake is defined as a commission that the house takes on each hand of poker. It’s essentially the price of playing at a casino and is collected by the dealer. The rake goes towards compensating the casino for its expenses in hosting the game, as well as incentivizing house players to compete against those sitting at the table.</p>
<p>The percentage taken from each pot depends on the stakes of the game, but typically falls between 2% and 5%. This means that for every $100 wagered in a hand, the house would take between $2 and $5. In some cases, particularly high-stakes games, the rake can be even higher.</p>
<p>There are also variations on how rake is collected – it can either be taken before or after each hand depending on the casino. However, most casinos use post-rake methods, which means that players have to pay their rake before they leave the table.</p>
<p>For players, casino rake can have a significant impact on their overall winnings. In addition to eating into your potential profits, it also reduces your chance of winning since you’re basically playing against an opponent who has an advantage (the house). This is why it’s important to always factor in rake when deciding whether or not to play a particular game.</p>
<p>In spite of this, however, poker remains one of the most popular casino games around thanks to its exciting action and potential for big wins. With careful bankroll management and a bit of luck, you could very well come out ahead in the end.</p>

The casino announced today that the decision was made after much deliberation and discussion. It is said that the company plans to reevaluate their footprint in the market and decide what avenue to take next.</p>
<p>The Sands Casino first opened in May of 2016 as an adjunct to the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas. At that time, there were high hopes for a successful venture, but things haven’t quite panned out as planned. Some industry insiders are saying that this move may be an indication that the Sands is looking to leave the Atlantic City market altogether.</p>
<p>Caesars Palace has been in operation since 1978 and has been known as one of the top casinos in Atlantic City. It’s unclear what will happen to the property now that the Sands is leaving, but it’s likely that another casino operator will step in and take over.</p>
<h1 id="Sands-Casino-to-Stop-at-Caesars-Atlantic-City"><a href="#Sands-Casino-to-Stop-at-Caesars-Atlantic-City" class="headerlink" title="Sands Casino to Stop at Caesars Atlantic City?"></a>Sands Casino to Stop at Caesars Atlantic City?</h1><p>On Thursday, July 12th, the Associated Press reported that the Sands Casino was in talks to purchase Caesars Atlantic City hotel-casino for $1.3 billion. This move would put the Sands in control of two of the city’s eleven casinos.</p>
<p>The potential acquisition would come as part of a larger trend in the industry, as casino companies look to expand their holdings in order to compete with new gaming destinations popping up across the country. For example, MGM Resorts purchased Treasure Island Resort and Casino in Iowa in March for $860 million.</p>
<p>Caesars Atlantic City is one of the city’s oldest and most iconic casinos, but it has been struggling in recent years. The company that owns it, Caesars Entertainment, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year.</p>
<p>In response to the news of the possible sale, shares of both Sands and Caesars rose sharply on Wall Street.</p>
<p>It is still unclear whether or not a deal will be reached, but if it does go through it would be one of the largest casino acquisitions in history.</p>

The casino offers a free shuttle bus service from various locations in the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos. The final destination for the shuttle bus service is the Sands Casino in Bethlehem.</p>
<p>There are four places where you can catch the Sands Casino shuttle bus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Northampton County:189 Fahy Dr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 </li>
<li>Monroe County: 1770 Route 209, Brodheadsville, PA 18322 </li>
<li>Lehigh County: 1 Stabler Lane, Suite 120, Bethlehem, PA 18015 </li>
<li>Pike County: 1475 Route 6 &amp; 209 Ste B, Milford, PA 18337</li>
</ul>
<p>The buses run every 30 minutes from each location and the last bus leaves at 2:00am.</p>

This stunning new development is a major addition to the city’s skyline and features a spectacular glass roof that will be lit up at night.</p>
<p>The casino resort is located in the heart of London’s entertainment district, and will offer visitors a wide range of luxury amenities, including a rooftop pool, spa, and nightclub. The casino itself will feature gaming tables and state-of-the-art slot machines, as well as a fine dining restaurant and several bars.</p>
<p>This is sure to be one of London’s most popular tourist destinations, and promises to be a major attraction for visitors from all over the world. So if you’re looking for some high-class fun in the city, make sure to check out the new casino resort!</p>
<h1 id="New-Casino-Resort-Had-Unclear-Origins"><a href="#New-Casino-Resort-Had-Unclear-Origins" class="headerlink" title="New Casino Resort Had Unclear Origins"></a>New Casino Resort Had Unclear Origins</h1><p>The new casino resort in town had an unclear origin. The casino’s developers refused to say where the money came from to build the massive complex, leading some to speculate that the funds may have been illegally obtained.</p>
<p>The casino was a huge hit with locals and tourists alike, and it quickly became one of the most popular destinations in town. But despite its popularity, the casino remained mired in controversy. Local residents and business owners complained that the casino was hurting their businesses, and that the large influx of people was causing traffic and other problems in the area.</p>
<p>The casino’s developers continued to insist that they had done nothing wrong, and that they had followed all of the appropriate procedures in building and opening the casino. But many people remained skeptical, and there were rumors that the casino’s origins were not as innocent as the developers claimed.</p>
<h1 id="Mysterious-Casino-Resort-in-London-Has-Uncertain-Architect"><a href="#Mysterious-Casino-Resort-in-London-Has-Uncertain-Architect" class="headerlink" title="Mysterious Casino Resort in London Has Uncertain Architect"></a>Mysterious Casino Resort in London Has Uncertain Architect</h1><p>A casino resort being built in the east side of London has some people scratching their heads as to who is behind the design. Local officials were expecting a proposal from a well-known and experienced casino company, but instead they received one from an unknown architectural firm.</p>
<p>The plans for the casino are very extravagant, with a large central tower that dominates the surrounding area. However, many residents are worried that the resort will not be able to generate enough business to be profitable, and that it will end up becoming a white elephant.</p>
<p>There has been no comment from the architectural firm about their involvement in the project, and local officials say that they have no idea who they are. The only thing that is known about them is that they have no previous experience in designing casinos.</p>
<h1 id="Who-is-the-Architect-of-the-Casino-Resort-in-Sherlock-Holmes’-London"><a href="#Who-is-the-Architect-of-the-Casino-Resort-in-Sherlock-Holmes’-London" class="headerlink" title="Who is the Architect of the Casino Resort in Sherlock Holmes’ London?"></a>Who is the Architect of the Casino Resort in Sherlock Holmes’ London?</h1><p>In the Sherlock Holmes stories, the fictional detective is often consulted about legal matters by his friend and associate, Dr. John Watson. In one story, “The Adventure of the Six Napoleons”, Holmes is asked to investigate the theft of a number of valuable coins from a London casino. The affable Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard collaborates on the case with Holmes. </p>
<p>In the story, Holmes is able to quickly determine that the thief was not an amateur but a professional who had planned and executed the robbery deliberately. He also deduces that the thief must be an expert in casinos, since he or she was able to avoid detection by security cameras and staff. </p>
<p>Given these facts, it is natural to ask: Who was the architect of the casino resort in Sherlock Holmes’ London? This question has yet to be definitively answered, but several candidates have been suggested over the years. </p>
<p>One possible candidate is American casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. Adelson is well-known for his lavish casino resorts, and he has been known to make generous donations to political campaigns. In 2012, he donated $5 million to Restore Our Future, a pro-Mitt Romney Super PAC. </p>
<p>Another possible candidate is Malaysian gambling tycoon Lim Kok Thay. Lim Kok Thay is the chairman and CEO of Genting Group, one of the largest casino companies in the world. Genting Group owns several high-profile casinos resorts around the world, including Resorts World Sentosa in Singapore and Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut. </p>
<p>It’s still not clear who exactly was responsible for designing Sherlock Holmes’ fictional casino resort, but it’s safe to say that it would have been a highly experienced and successful casino architect!</p>
<h1 id="Uncertainty-Surrounds-Role-of-Architect-in-London-Casino-Resort"><a href="#Uncertainty-Surrounds-Role-of-Architect-in-London-Casino-Resort" class="headerlink" title="Uncertainty Surrounds Role of Architect in London Casino Resort"></a>Uncertainty Surrounds Role of Architect in London Casino Resort</h1><p>Planning permission for the £2bn London casino resort was granted in May of this year, but with uncertainty surrounding the role of the architect in the project. </p>
<p>The architect, EPR Architects, withdrew from the project in late September, and the developer, Asian Coast Development Ltd (ACDL), is now looking for a replacement. The project is said to be around 70% complete, so it is essential that a new architect is found quickly to avoid any further delays.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for ACDL said: “EPR’s departure will not affect the overall development schedule or budget of the project. We remain on track to open in 2020 and are working with our delivery partners to ensure a smooth transition.”</p>
<p>It is not clear why EPR Architects withdrew from the project, but it is thought that there may have been disagreements over design and construction issues.</p>

        <h1 id="Casino-Dealers-in-England-League-Game-can-make-up-to-100K-Annually"><a href="#Casino-Dealers-in-England-League-Game-can-make-up-to-100K-Annually" class="headerlink" title="Casino Dealers in England League Game can make up to $100K Annually!"></a>Casino Dealers in England League Game can make up to $100K Annually!</h1><p>Casino dealers in England can make up to $100,000 annually, new data suggests.</p>
<p>The average wage for a casino dealer in the UK is around £21,600 (US$27,700), according to research by jobs site Glassdoor. But the top 10% of earners take home an average salary of £45,000 (US$58,800), while the top 1% boast an annual income of £75,000 (US$97,800).</p>
<p>The news will come as music to the ears of those working in casinos across the country – and could rival the wages on offer in other high-paying industries such as finance or law.</p>
<p>So what exactly puts casino dealers in pole position when it comes to earning potential? It’s all down to tips from players.</p>
<p>“It’s no secret that casino dealers can make a lot of money from tips, especially if they work in a high-roller room or for a VIP table,” says careers expert Lynn Taylor. “But even those who work on regular tables can earn a healthy salary from gratuities. In fact, many casinos have policies that state dealers must be tipped for providing good service.”</p>
<p>And it’s not just those at the top of the pay scale who benefit from generous tipping. Casino floor staff – such as croupiers, pit bosses and supervisors – can also make supplementary income from gratuities on top of their basic salary.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a well-paid job with good tips, a career as a casino dealer could be just the thing for you.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Dealers-rake-in-over-50-000-in-tips-during-a-season"><a href="#Casino-Dealers-rake-in-over-50-000-in-tips-during-a-season" class="headerlink" title="Casino Dealers rake in over $50,000 in tips during a season!"></a>Casino Dealers rake in over $50,000 in tips during a season!</h1><p>While some casino dealers may start out with a salary as low as $25,000 per year, they can make much more in tips. In fact, many dealers take home more than $50,000 during a season.</p>
<p>The amount of tips a dealer takes in depends on a number of factors, including the type of casino, the size of the casino, and the number of players at the table. However, most dealers report taking home an average of $20-$30 per hour in tips.</p>
<p>There are a few things that you can do to ensure that you leave your dealer with a bountiful tip. First, be sure to observe proper etiquette at the table. Don’t talk loudly or blow on your cards. Second, try to tip consistent amounts for each hand. Finally, be generous when it comes to tipping big jackpot winners.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a way to show your appreciation for a job well done, tipping your dealer is a great way to do it!</p>
<h1 id="Highest-tipped-casino-dealer-in-an-England-League-Game-makes-6-000-in-one-day"><a href="#Highest-tipped-casino-dealer-in-an-England-League-Game-makes-6-000-in-one-day" class="headerlink" title="Highest tipped casino dealer in an England League Game makes $6,000 in one day!"></a>Highest tipped casino dealer in an England League Game makes $6,000 in one day!</h1><p>A casino dealer in Sunderland, England made an impressive $6,000 in a single day after receiving some high tips from players. The lucky dealer was working at the Genting Casino when a number of large bets came in, boosting their income for the day.</p>
<p>The Genting Casino is one of the largest in England and is known for its high-stakes gambling. With games like blackjack and roulette available, it’s no surprise that some players like to go all out with their bets. This can lead to some seriously big payouts for dealers and staff working at the casino.</p>
<p>In this case, the Sunderland dealer was more than happy to take home an extra $6,000 on top of their regular wage. It’s definitely an exciting way to make a living and shows just how lucrative casino work can be. If you’re looking for a career that comes with plenty of excitement and potential for big rewards, then casino work may be just what you’re looking for!</p>
<h1 id="How-much-money-do-casino-dealers-really-make"><a href="#How-much-money-do-casino-dealers-really-make" class="headerlink" title="How much money do casino dealers really make?"></a>How much money do casino dealers really make?</h1><p>If you’re looking for a high-paying career that doesn’t require a lot of education or experience, then becoming a casino dealer may be the right fit for you. But how much can you expect to make as a casino dealer?</p>
<p>The answer to this question depends on a number of factors, including the casino where you work, the type of game you deal, and your experience level. However, most casino dealers earn an hourly wage that ranges from $8 to $22.</p>
<p>In addition to their hourly wage, casino dealers also typically receive tips from players. How much you make in tips will depend on your ability to interact with players and your skill at dealing cards or spinning roulette wheels. Some dealers can earn tips in excess of $100 per hour, while others may only make a few dollars per hour.</p>
<p>So what’s the bottom line? Casino dealers can make a good living, but it’s not always easy money. The best way to find out exactly how much money you can expect to make as a casino dealer is to speak with employers in your area.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Dealers-bring-home-an-average-of-71-000-annually"><a href="#Casino-Dealers-bring-home-an-average-of-71-000-annually" class="headerlink" title="Casino Dealers bring home an average of $71,000 annually"></a>Casino Dealers bring home an average of $71,000 annually</h1><p>Casino dealers earn a median wage of $11.68 an hour, or about $24,000 a year. But with tips, many dealers can make much more. The average annual salary for casino dealers, including both hourly wages and tips, is $71,000.</p>
<p>The best-paid 10 percent of casino dealers earn more than $92,000 a year. And while the lowest-paid 10 percent earn less than $18,000 a year, most casino dealers in that group still make more than the national median wage of $11.68 an hour.</p>
<p>Most casino dealers work for gaming companies that operate casinos or gaming tables at other locations such as hotels, racetracks or cruise ships. Some work in card rooms where people can gamble using their own money.</p>
<p>Many casinos are also looking for dealers who can speak multiple languages to cater to international guests.</p>
<p>The job of casino dealer has been around since the early days of gambling and it has evolved along with the industry. Dealers used to be known as croupiers, from the French word meaning “counter” or “banker.” </p>
<p>As gambling has expanded around the world, so has the need for dealers who can communicate with players in different languages. Today there are dealers who speak English, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese and other languages in casinos around the globe.</p>
<p>There are no formal education requirements to become a casino dealer. However, many casinos prefer to hire employees who have some knowledge of card games and basic math skills. Previous customer service experience is also helpful. </p>
<p>Dealers typically go through a training program at the casino where they will be working before they start dealing cards or spinning roulette wheels for guests.</p>

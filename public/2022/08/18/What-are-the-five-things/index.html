        <h1 id="What-are-the-five-things"><a href="#What-are-the-five-things" class="headerlink" title="What are the five things?"></a>What are the five things?</h1><p>The five things are essential items that everyone should have in their personal emergency kit. The first item is a first-aid kit. This is important for any type of emergency, from a small cut to a larger injury. The second item is water. You will need at least one gallon of water per person per day for drinking and sanitation. The third item is food. You will need at least three days’ worth of non-perishable food items. The fourth item is a flashlight. This is important for both general safety and being able to see in the event of a power outage. The fifth and final item is cash. In the event of an emergency, you may not be able to access your bank account or credit cards. Having cash on hand will help you to buy necessary supplies or evacuate if needed.</p>
<h1 id="What-if-you-don’t-turn-30-in-2022"><a href="#What-if-you-don’t-turn-30-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="What if you don’t turn 30 in 2022?"></a>What if you don’t turn 30 in 2022?</h1><p>There are a lot of articles out there on what you should do if you don’t turn 30 by the end of 2022. But what if you don’t turn 30 in 2022 and you’re already past your late twenties? What then?</p>
<p>Actually, a lot of the advice given in those other articles still applies. You still need to get in shape, work on your career, save money, and network. But there are a few other things you can do to make sure you hit 30 feeling great.</p>
<p>One thing to consider is continuing your education. If you haven’t completed your degree yet, now might be the time to do so. Alternatively, you could take some classes to learn new skills or update your existing ones.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that it’s never too late to start a new hobby or improve your current one. If you’ve always wanted to learn how to play the piano, for example, now is the time to do it! Not only will this keep you busy and engaged, but it can also help improve your life in other ways, such as making new friends or discovering new interests.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t forget to enjoy yourself! Make sure to take some time for yourself every day to relax and de-stress. Whether that means taking a walk outdoors, reading your favorite book, or spending time with friends and family, make sure to take some time for yourself every day. This will help keep you happy and healthy both mentally and physically.</p>
<h1 id="Why-do-they-have-to-be-five"><a href="#Why-do-they-have-to-be-five" class="headerlink" title="Why do they have to be five?"></a>Why do they have to be five?</h1><p>There are many debates around the world on what is the best number. But when it comes to the number of toes on a human foot, there seems to be a general consensus that five is ideal. Why do they have to be five?</p>
<p>There are many theories out there as to why humans have five toes on each foot. One popular belief is that our toe number is due to our ancestors’ need for dexterity and balance when walking in trees. Another idea is that humans evolved to have five toes so that we can better grip the ground when running.</p>
<p>A recent study published in the journal “PLOS One” sought to answer this question by examining the fossil records of humans and their closest relatives, as well as modern day humans. The study found that while there was no one definitive answer, it is most likely that our toe number is a result of both natural selection and genetic drift.</p>
<p>So why do they have to be five? The truth is, we’re not sure. But it’s likely that this toe number has served us well over time, providing us with better dexterity and balance when walking and running.</p>
<h1 id="What-if-you-only-know-four-things"><a href="#What-if-you-only-know-four-things" class="headerlink" title="What if you only know four things?"></a>What if you only know four things?</h1><p>The title of this piece is based on a question that was posed to me by one of my mentors. It’s a question that’s stayed with me, because it’s so thought-provoking.</p>
<p>At its heart, the question asks: What if you only knew four things? What would those four things be?</p>
<p>I’ve given this a lot of thought, and my answer is:</p>
<ol>
<li>The world is full of beauty and mystery.</li>
<li>We are all capable of extraordinary things.</li>
<li>Life is precious and should be lived fully.</li>
<li>We are all connected, and our actions have consequences.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="What-if-you-turn-30-in-2020"><a href="#What-if-you-turn-30-in-2020" class="headerlink" title="What if you turn 30 in 2020?"></a>What if you turn 30 in 2020?</h1><p>It’s not too late to turn 30 in 2020! If you’re feeling like you want to jump on the bandwagon and turn 30 this year, there are plenty of things you can do to make sure it’s a memorable experience. Here are some tips for making your 30th birthday one to remember:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a big party!</li>
</ol>
<p>This is probably the most obvious suggestion, but it’s also the most fun. Invite all of your friends and family members, and plan a party that will be remembered for years to come. You could have a themed party, or just go all out with decorations, food, and drinks. The more people who come, the better!</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Make resolutions for your 30s</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the best things about turning 30 is that it’s a time to start fresh and set new goals for yourself. Why not make resolutions for your 30s that will help you live a happier and healthier life? Some possible resolutions include eating healthier, exercising more, spending more time with family and friends, and learning new things.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Travel to new places</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s no better time than your 30th birthday to travel to new places and explore the world. Whether you decide to go on a trip by yourself or with friends, there are endless possibilities waiting for you. Places like Europe, Asia, and South America are all popular destinations for those celebrating their 30th birthday.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Set new career goals</li>
</ol>
<p>Another thing that happens when you turn 30 is that you start reflecting on your career so far. Are you happy with where you are professionally? If not, now is the time to start setting some new goals and planning out how you’ll achieve them. Maybe you want to pursue a new degree or certification in order to move up at your job; or maybe you’d like to start your own business. Whatever it is, don’t be afraid to go after what you want in life.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Start thinking about retirement</li>
</ol>
<p>Speaking of careers, one thing that becomes increasingly important as you reach your 30s is retirement planning. It may seem like a long way off, but now is the time to start thinking about how much money you’ll need saved up in order to comfortably retire someday. If you need some help getting started, there are plenty of resources available online or through financial advisors.</p>

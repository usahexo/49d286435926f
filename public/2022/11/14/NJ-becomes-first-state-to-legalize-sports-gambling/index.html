        <h1 id="NJ-becomes-first-state-to-legalize-sports-gambling"><a href="#NJ-becomes-first-state-to-legalize-sports-gambling" class="headerlink" title="NJ becomes first state to legalize sports gambling"></a>NJ becomes first state to legalize sports gambling</h1><p>On Monday, New Jersey became the first state in the United States to legalize sports gambling, overturning a ban that has been in place for more than two decades. The landmark ruling was made by the US Supreme Court, which voted 6-3 in favor of New Jersey.</p>
<p>Governor Phil Murphy hailed the decision as a victory for the people of New Jersey, who have been pushing for legalization for years. “This is a great day for the rights of states and their people to make their own decisions,” he said.</p>
<p>Sports bettors in the state are already celebrating, and many are eager to get their hands on those all-important betting slips. “I’ve been waiting for this day for years,” said one regular gambler. “I can’t wait to start betting on sports.”</p>
<p>Not everyone is happy with the decision, however, with some arguing that it will lead to addiction and other social problems. But Governor Murphy is confident that New Jersey can handle legalized sports gambling responsibly.</p>
<p>“We have put in place strong consumer protections,” he said. “And we are prepared to deal with any potential negative consequences.”</p>
<p>The legalization of sports gambling is a major victory for Governor Murphy and his new administration. It’s also a win for the people of New Jersey, who can now enjoy this popular pastime without having to break the law.</p>
<h1 id="Supreme-Court-strikes-down-federal-ban-on-sports-gambling"><a href="#Supreme-Court-strikes-down-federal-ban-on-sports-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Supreme Court strikes down federal ban on sports gambling"></a>Supreme Court strikes down federal ban on sports gambling</h1><p>The United States Supreme Court has struck down a law prohibiting most states from legalizing sports gambling, in a landmark decision that could lead to a nationwide overhaul of the country’s tightly-regulated betting industry.</p>
<p>In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) unconstitutional because it violated the principle of state’s rights. The law had effectively banned legal sports betting with the exception of Nevada.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito, who delivered the opinion of the court, said that PASPA “unequivocally dictates what states may and may not do.” He added that the law “violates the anti-commandeering doctrine” by preventing states from making their own decisions about whether to allow gambling within their borders.</p>
<p>The ruling is a major victory for those who have long argued that sports gambling should be legalized and regulated as a means of generating new revenue for cash-strapped states and casinos. It also represents a major defeat for the NFL, NBA, MLB and other professional sports leagues, which had lobbied hard against legalization.</p>
<p>The fallout from Monday’s ruling is likely to be far-reaching, with experts predicting that individual states will now move quickly to legalize various forms of sports betting. Delaware, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington have already taken steps to do so in anticipation of Monday’s ruling.</p>
<p>Nevada is expected to be one of the biggest winners in Monday’s ruling, as it will now become the only state where people can bet on single games. The state’s gaming industry is worth an estimated $250 billion and employs over 150,000 people.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-becomes-second-state-to-legalize-sports-gambling"><a href="#Delaware-becomes-second-state-to-legalize-sports-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware becomes second state to legalize sports gambling"></a>Delaware becomes second state to legalize sports gambling</h1><p>On Tuesday, the Delaware state Senate voted 12-9 to legalize sports gambling in the state. This makes Delaware the second state in the US to legalize sports gambling, after New Jersey.</p>
<p>Governor John Carney is expected to sign the bill into law, which would then allow casinos and racetracks in Delaware to offer betting on professional and college sports. The bill allows bets to be placed both online and at physical locations.</p>
<p>Sports gambling is a popular pastime across the US, with an estimated $150 billion wagered each year. However, it has only been legal in a handful of states.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalized sports gambling argue that it will bring much-needed revenue to state governments. They also point out that it can help keep people from placing illegal bets, and that it can be used to track betting patterns in order to detect potential match-fixing.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and financial ruin for players and fans. They also say that it can damage the integrity of sporting events.</p>
<p>Delaware is not the only state considering legalizing sports gambling. A bill is currently pending in the New York state Assembly, and there is also legalization legislation pending in Michigan, Rhode Island, and West Virginia.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-becomes-third-state-to-legalize-sports-gambling"><a href="#Pennsylvania-becomes-third-state-to-legalize-sports-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania becomes third state to legalize sports gambling"></a>Pennsylvania becomes third state to legalize sports gambling</h1><p>On Tuesday, May 15, 2018, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives voted 102-71 in favor of legalizing sports betting within the state. This makes Pennsylvania the third state in the nation to offer legalized sports gambling, after New Jersey and Delaware.</p>
<p>The new law allows casinos in the state to take bets on sporting events, with wagers being placed both in person and online. Bettors will have to be at least 21 years old, and the minimum age for participation in online sports gambling will be 18. It is still unclear how much tax revenue the new law will generate for the state government, but it is estimated that it could bring in as much as $100 million annually.</p>
<p>This is a major victory for casino owners and lawmakers in Pennsylvania, who have been pushing for legalized sports gambling for years. They see it as a way to help struggling casinos stay afloat, while also bringing in much-needed tax revenue.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports gambling say that it will lead to more gambling addiction and other social problems. But supporters argue that it is already happening illegally and that legalization will allow the government to regulate and tax it.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how this new law will play out in Pennsylvania, but it is another sign that legalized sports betting is becoming more mainstream across the country.</p>
<h1 id="More-states-expected-to-legalize-sports-gambling-in-wake-of-Supreme-Court-ruling"><a href="#More-states-expected-to-legalize-sports-gambling-in-wake-of-Supreme-Court-ruling" class="headerlink" title="More states expected to legalize sports gambling in wake of Supreme Court ruling"></a>More states expected to legalize sports gambling in wake of Supreme Court ruling</h1><p>Earlier in the year, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear a case that would determine the legality of sports gambling across the country. The decision came in May 2018, with the Supreme Court ruling in favor of legalizing sports gambling, striking down a federal law that prohibited most states from allowing betting on sporting events.</p>
<p>Since the ruling, multiple states have announced plans to legalize sports gambling. Delaware became the first state to take advantage of the ruling, launching its sports betting app on June 5. Rhode Island plans to have its own sports betting app ready by August. Mississippi and West Virginia are also expected to launch their own sports betting apps relatively soon.</p>
<p>Other states are also considering legalizing sports gambling. New York is one such state; lawmakers there are currently debating a bill that would allow wagers on both professional and collegiate sporting events. If passed, New York would become one of the largest states for legal sports gambling.</p>
<p>What Does This Mean for Gamblers?</p>
<p>The legalization of sports gambling means that gamblers now have more options when it comes to placing bets on sporting events. In addition to traditional methods such as bookmakers and offshore sites, gamblers can now place bets through state-run apps and websites. This could lead to increased profits for casinos and other businesses that offer sports betting services.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that this ruling does not affect daily fantasy sports (DFS). DFS is still considered a game of skill, and as such is not subject to federal or state laws regarding gambling. However, some states have introduced legislation that would prohibit DFS games offered by companies like FanDuel and DraftKings.</p>
<p>What Does This Mean for Sports?</p>
<p>The legalization of sports gambling will likely have a negative impact on professional and collegiate sports organizations. Bettors no longer need to risk illegal activities (such as paying someone to fix a game) in order to place bets on sporting events; they can now do so through legal means such as state-run websites and apps. This could lead to an increase in match fixing and other forms of cheating.</p>
<p>It is also possible that legalized sports gambling will increase the amount of money spent on betting pools for major sporting events such as the Super Bowl or the World Cup. This could lead to decreased profits for teams and athletes, as well as for broadcasters and other businesses that rely on advertising revenue from major sporting events.</p>

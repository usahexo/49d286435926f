        <h1 id="Atlantic-City-Gears-Up-For-Short-Term-2-Casino-Game"><a href="#Atlantic-City-Gears-Up-For-Short-Term-2-Casino-Game" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City Gears Up For Short-Term 2 Casino Game"></a>Atlantic City Gears Up For Short-Term 2 Casino Game</h1><p>In the wake of Pennsylvania’s recent legalization of casino gaming, New Jersey is ratcheting up its own preparations for the expected surge in visitors to Atlantic City. The state has announced a short-term 2 casino game that will allow holders of existing casino licenses to offer table games and slots. This will help to ease congestion at the city’s casinos and should result in increased tax revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Atlantic City’s casinos have been struggling in recent years, as neighboring states have begun offering gaming. In an effort to revive the city’s fortunes, New Jersey has been working to expand gambling options beyond just casinos. These efforts include online gaming and sports betting, which are both now legal in the state.</p>
<p>The short-term 2 casino game is seen as a stopgap measure until those other initiatives take hold. The state is hoping that the additional games will help attract more visitors to Atlantic City and breathe new life into its casino industry.</p>
<h1 id="Connecticut’s-Foxwoods-Casino-Hopes-To-Draw-Revenue-From-Offshore-Gaming"><a href="#Connecticut’s-Foxwoods-Casino-Hopes-To-Draw-Revenue-From-Offshore-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Connecticut’s Foxwoods Casino Hopes To Draw Revenue From Offshore Gaming"></a>Connecticut’s Foxwoods Casino Hopes To Draw Revenue From Offshore Gaming</h1><p>Connecticut’s Slot Machine Revenue Is Down, But Its Casino Hopes To Draw Revenue From Offshore Gaming. </p>
<p>In the last fiscal year, the revenue from slot machines in Connecticut was down 3.5%. This is in part due to new competition from casinos in neighboring states. Foxwoods Resort Casino, located in Ledyard, Connecticut, is hoping to draw some of its lost revenue back with plans to offer online gaming.</p>
<p>The casino has entered into an agreement with GAN, a leading digital gaming provider, to offer online gaming products including poker, slots and table games. The games will be available to players in New Jersey and Nevada first, with other states to follow later.<br>In a statement, Damian Aspinall, Chairman of GAN, said: “We are delighted to partner with Foxwoods Resort Casino – a world-renowned casino brand – as our first U.S.-based real money gaming customer. We look forward to working closely with Foxwoods’ team to bring an engaging suite of real money gaming products to their players.”</p>
<p>Foxwoods has not yet released any details about what the games will look like or when they will be available. However, it is expected that they will be similar to the games currently offered on online casinos websites such as PokerStars and 888poker. These games are typically played on computers or mobile devices using apps downloaded from the internet.</p>
<p>Players in New Jersey and Nevada can already participate in online gambling through state-licensed websites. In Nevada, for example, there are more than 20 licensed operators offering a variety of games such as poker, blackjack and slots. Delaware also offers online gambling through three licensed websites.</p>
<p>Other states are likely to follow Connecticut’s lead and legalize online gambling in the coming years. This is because legalizing online gambling can provide a significant boost to state revenue. A study by Stanford University found that legalizing online gambling could generate up to $8 billion per year in tax revenue nationwide.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Officials-Brace-For-Influx-of-Offshore-Gamblers"><a href="#Delaware-Officials-Brace-For-Influx-of-Offshore-Gamblers" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Officials Brace For Influx of Offshore Gamblers"></a>Delaware Officials Brace For Influx of Offshore Gamblers</h1><p>As states race to legalize gambling, officials in Delaware are preparing for an influx of casino players from offshore locales.</p>
<p>Delaware already has three casinos, and lawmakers are now looking at ways to expand gambling opportunities in the state. This includes considering new games, such as sports betting, as well as expanding the hours and locations of existing casinos.</p>
<p>One challenge for Delaware is that it shares a border with Pennsylvania, which recently legalized gambling. This means that many potential Delaware casino customers may opt to gamble closer to home instead.</p>
<p>Offshore gambling has been around for decades, but it has become increasingly popular in recent years. Thanks to the internet, people can now place bets on sporting events and other activities from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>This has led to a boom in online casinos, which allow players to gamble using real money. Many of these casinos are based offshore, in jurisdictions where gambling is legal.</p>
<p>This can be risky for players, as there is no guarantee that they will get their money back if they win. Some offshore casinos have been known to scam players out of their winnings.</p>
<p>Despite these risks, many people continue to gamble at offshore casinos. This is likely due to the fact that these casinos often offer better odds and more lucrative bonuses than their domestic counterparts.</p>
<h1 id="Maryland-Anticipates-Increased-Revenue-from-Offshore-Gaming"><a href="#Maryland-Anticipates-Increased-Revenue-from-Offshore-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Maryland Anticipates Increased Revenue from Offshore Gaming"></a>Maryland Anticipates Increased Revenue from Offshore Gaming</h1><p>The state of Maryland expects to generate increased revenue from the legalization of offshore gaming. The new measure, which was passed in 2018, is designed to allow for casino-style gambling on cruise ships in international waters.</p>
<p>Offshore gaming is a multi-billion dollar industry, and Maryland officials believe that they can capture a significant portion of the market. The measure has generated some controversy, with opponents arguing that it will lead to increased crime and social ills.</p>
<p>Supporters of the measure argue that it will create jobs and generate economic growth. They also point out that the state already has a robust gaming industry, including many casinos located onshore.</p>
<p>Maryland officials are hopeful that the new measure will help to offset some of the state’s budgetary challenges. The state is facing a deficit of several hundred million dollars, and officials believe that offshore gaming can help to fill the gap.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Prepares-for-Second-Wave-of-Offshore-Gaming"><a href="#New-Jersey-Prepares-for-Second-Wave-of-Offshore-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Prepares for Second Wave of Offshore Gaming"></a>New Jersey Prepares for Second Wave of Offshore Gaming</h1><p>When New Jersey legalized online gambling in 2013, it was the first state in the nation to do so. It was also a move that would set the stage for other states to follow suit. Fast forward to 2019 and New Jersey is preparing for its second wave of offshore gaming.</p>
<p>Offshore gaming, which is also known as iGaming, refers to the playing of casino games and betting on sports events over the internet. It is a rapidly growing industry that is expected to generate more than $60 billion in revenue by 2020. And New Jersey is one of the key players in this market.</p>
<p>In fact, New Jersey accounts for more than one-third of all online gambling revenue generated in the United States. This is due in large part to the fact that New Jersey has been at the forefront of regulating and promoting online gaming.</p>
<p>The first wave of offshore gaming was marked by a number of significant milestones for New Jersey’s online gambling industry. These include the launch of new casino sites, the growth of online poker, and the expansion of mobile gaming.</p>
<p>Now, with the second wave of offshore gaming set to begin, New Jersey is positioned to become even more dominant in this market. Here are some of the key developments that we can expect to see over the next few years:</p>
<ol>
<li>The growth of virtual sports betting</li>
</ol>
<p>Virtual sports betting is one of the key growth areas in the offshore gaming market. This type of betting involves wagering on simulated sporting events that are created using computer-generated imagery (CGI).</p>
<p>The popularity of virtual sports betting can be attributed to a number factors, including its convenience and excitement factor. With virtual sports betting, bettors can place bets on events around the clock, without having to wait for live games to take place. And because these events are simulated, there is always a chance for big payouts – even when the odds are against you.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The growth of esports betting</li>
</ol>
<p>Another key trend in offshore gaming is esports betting. Esports – or electronic sports – refers to competitive video gaming tournaments where players battle it out for prize money and glory.</p>
<p>With its fast-paced action and unpredictable outcomes, esports has quickly become one of the most popular forms of entertainment around the world. And now with esports betting, fans have another way to get involved in these competitions.</p>
<p>Esports betting offers bettors a wide range of bets options, including match winners, map winners, and first blood matches. And with prize pools reaching into millions of dollars, there’s plenty at stake for bettors!</p>

The tribesmen, who called themselves the JungleRaja, had never seen Europeans before and were naturally quite curious about these strange newcomers. The Dutchmen, in turn, were fascinated by the JungleRaja’s way of life and decided to stay with them for a while to learn more about their customs.</p>
<p>The Dutchmen soon discovered that the JungleRaja were expert hunters and trackers, and were able to live off the land in complete harmony with their environment. They also found that the JungleRaja were a warlike people who did not take kindly to outsiders trespassing on their territory. Over time, the Dutchmen managed to gain the trust of the JungleRaja and even taught them how to make firearms and other modern tools.</p>
<p>In 1933, a group of Japanese soldiers traveled through the jungle and encountered the JungleRaja. Unlike the Dutchmen, the Japanese soldiers immediately began looting and pillaging the tribe’s villages, taking whatever they could get their hands on. The JungleRaja fought back bravely but were no match for the well-armed Japanese troops. Many members of the tribe were killed or captured, while others fled into the jungle in hopes of finding safety.</p>
<p>The events that unfolded in 1933 would have a profound impact on JungleRaja society forever. The tribe’s contact with outsiders had shown them that there were much larger and more powerful civilizations beyond their isolated homeland, and this realization would eventually lead them to abandon their traditional way of life in favor of adopting modernity.</p>

<p>Finally, JungleRaja was born out of necessity. Ridho and Aya found it difficult to find good quality Indonesian food when they were travelling, so they decided to make it themselves. They set up a small food stall in Bali and it was an instant success; people loved the authentic flavours and spices of their dishes. This gave them the confidence to take the next step and open their own restaurant in Jakarta.</p>

are the five things","date":"2022-08-17T16:48:06.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  What are the five things?\n\nThe five things are essential items that everyone should have in their personal emergency kit. The first item is a first-aid kit. This is important for any type of emergency, from a small cut to a larger injury. The second item is water. You will need at least one gallon of water per person per day for drinking and sanitation. The third item is food. You will need at least three days’ worth of non-perishable food items. The fourth item is a flashlight. This is important for both general safety and being able to see in the event of a power outage. The fifth and final item is cash. In the event of an emergency, you may not be able to access your bank account or credit cards. Having cash on hand will help you to buy necessary supplies or evacuate if needed.\n\n#  What if you don't turn 30 in 2022?\n\nThere are a lot of articles out there on what you should do if you don't turn 30 by the end of 2022. But what if you don't turn 30 in 2022 and you're already past your late twenties? What then?\n\nActually, a lot of the advice given in those other articles still applies. You still need to get in shape, work on your career, save money, and network. But there are a few other things you can do to make sure you hit 30 feeling great.\n\nOne thing to consider is continuing your education. If you haven't completed your degree yet, now might be the time to do so. Alternatively, you could take some classes to learn new skills or update your existing ones.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that it's never too late to start a new hobby or improve your current one. If you've always wanted to learn how to play the piano, for example, now is the time to do it! Not only will this keep you busy and engaged, but it can also help improve your life in other ways, such as making new friends or discovering new interests.\n\nFinally, don't forget to enjoy yourself! Make sure to take some time for yourself every day to relax and de-stress. Whether that means taking a walk outdoors, reading your favorite book, or spending time with friends and family, make sure to take some time for yourself every day. This will help keep you happy and healthy both mentally and physically.\n\n#  Why do they have to be five?\n\nThere are many debates around the world on what is the best number. But when it comes to the number of toes on a human foot, there seems to be a general consensus that five is ideal. Why do they have to be five?\n\nThere are many theories out there as to why humans have five toes on each foot. One popular belief is that our toe number is due to our ancestors’ need for dexterity and balance when walking in trees. Another idea is that humans evolved to have five toes so that we can better grip the ground when running.\n\nA recent study published in the journal “PLOS One” sought to answer this question by examining the fossil records of humans and their closest relatives, as well as modern day humans. The study found that while there was no one definitive answer, it is most likely that our toe number is a result of both natural selection and genetic drift.\n\nSo why do they have to be five? The truth is, we’re not sure. But it’s likely that this toe number has served us well over time, providing us with better dexterity and balance when walking and running.\n\n#  What if you only know four things?\n\nThe title of this piece is based on a question that was posed to me by one of my mentors. It's a question that's stayed with me, because it's so thought-provoking.\n\nAt its heart, the question asks: What if you only knew four things? What would those four things be?\n\nI've given this a lot of thought, and my answer is:\n\n1. The world is full of beauty and mystery.\n2. We are all capable of extraordinary things.\n3. Life is precious and should be lived fully.\n4. We are all connected, and our actions have consequences.\n\n#  What if you turn 30 in 2020?\n\nIt's not too late to turn 30 in 2020! If you're feeling like you want to jump on the bandwagon and turn 30 this year, there are plenty of things you can do to make sure it's a memorable experience. Here are some tips for making your 30th birthday one to remember:\n\n1. Have a big party!\n\nThis is probably the most obvious suggestion, but it's also the most fun. Invite all of your friends and family members, and plan a party that will be remembered for years to come. You could have a themed party, or just go all out with decorations, food, and drinks. The more people who come, the better!\n\n2. Make resolutions for your 30s\n\nOne of the best things about turning 30 is that it's a time to start fresh and set new goals for yourself.

The first item is a first-aid kit. This is important for any type of emergency, from a small cut to a larger injury. The second item is water. You will need at least one gallon of water per person per day for drinking and sanitation. The third item is food. You will need at least three days’ worth of non-perishable food items. The fourth item is a flashlight. This is important for both general safety and being able to see in the event of a power outage. The fifth and final item is cash. In the event of an emergency, you may not be able to access your bank account or credit cards. Having cash on hand will help you to buy necessary supplies or evacuate if needed.\n\n#  What if you don't turn 30 in 2022?\n\nThere are a lot of articles out there on what you should do if you don't turn 30 by the end of 2022. But what if you don't turn 30 in 2022 and you're already past your late twenties? What then?\n\nActually, a lot of the advice given in those other articles still applies. You still need to get in shape, work on your career, save money, and network. But there are a few other things you can do to make sure you hit 30 feeling great.\n\nOne thing to consider is continuing your education. If you haven't completed your degree yet, now might be the time to do so. Alternatively, you could take some classes to learn new skills or update your existing ones.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that it's never too late to start a new hobby or improve your current one. If you've always wanted to learn how to play the piano, for example, now is the time to do it! Not only will this keep you busy and engaged, but it can also help improve your life in other ways, such as making new friends or discovering new interests.\n\nFinally, don't forget to enjoy yourself! Make sure to take some time for yourself every day to relax and de-stress. Whether that means taking a walk outdoors, reading your favorite book, or spending time with friends and family, make sure to take some time for yourself every day. This will help keep you happy and healthy both mentally and physically.\n\n#  Why do they have to be five?\n\nThere are many debates around the world on what is the best number. But when it comes to the number of toes on a human foot, there seems to be a general consensus that five is ideal. Why do they have to be five?\n\nThere are many theories out there as to why humans have five toes on each foot. One popular belief is that our toe number is due to our ancestors’ need for dexterity and balance when walking in trees. Another idea is that humans evolved to have five toes so that we can better grip the ground when running.\n\nA recent study published in the journal “PLOS One” sought to answer this question by examining the fossil records of humans and their closest relatives, as well as modern day humans. The study found that while there was no one definitive answer, it is most likely that our toe number is a result of both natural selection and genetic drift.\n\nSo why do they have to be five? The truth is, we’re not sure.

Increasingly, consumers are choosing to purchase these items online rather than in stores. There are a number of benefits to shopping for fashion, beauty, and lifestyle items online.\n\nThe first benefit of shopping for fashion, beauty, and lifestyle items online is that it is convenient. Consumers can shop for these items at any time of day or night from the comfort of their own home. They do not need to go out and battle traffic and find parking.\n\nAnother benefit of shopping for fashion, beauty, and lifestyle items online is that there is a greater variety of options available. Consumers can search through multiple stores and brands to find the best products that fit their needs. Additionally, they can compare prices between different stores to find the best deals.\n\nA third benefit of shopping for fashion, beauty, and lifestyle items online is that it is often cheaper than buying these items in store. Online retailers have lower overhead costs than brick-and-mortar stores so they can offer lower prices. Additionally, consumers can take advantage of coupons and discounts offered by online retailers.\n\nFinally, one of the greatest benefits of shopping for fashion, beauty, and lifestyle items online is that consumers can read reviews from other shoppers before making a purchase decision. This allows them to make informed decisions about which products are worth buying and which ones are not.\n\n#  How can you find the right online store for you?\n\nShopping online is a great way to find what you need and save money at the same time. However, with so many online stores to choose from, it can be hard to know which one is right for you. Here are some tips for finding the right online store for you:\n\n1. Know what you need.\n\nThe first step in finding the right online store is knowing what you need. Do you need a specific type of product? Or are you looking for a certain brand or retailer? Once you know what you're looking for, it will be easier to find the right online store.\n\n2. Look for reviews.\n\nOnce you've narrowed down your options, take a look at the reviews to see what people have said about the store. Are the products good quality? Is the customer service good? Are there any shipping or returns policies that are unfavorable? Reading reviews can help you make an informed decision about whether or not a particular store is right for you.\n\n3. Compare prices and shipping costs.\n\nAnother important factor to consider when choosing an online store is price and shipping costs. Make sure to compare prices between different stores and factor in shipping costs as well. Some stores may have lower prices but higher shipping costs, while others may have higher prices but lower shipping costs. It's important to consider all aspects of a purchase before deciding which store is best for you.\n\n4. Check out the return policy.\n\nIf you're not sure whether or not a particular product is going to work out, it's important to check out the return policy before making a purchase. Some stores have very strict return policies, while others are more lenient. It's important to find a store that has a return policy that fits your needs.\n\n5. Find a store that's trustworthy.\n\nWhen shopping online, it's important to find a store that you can trust. Make sure that the website uses secure encryption technology and check the Better Business Bureau rating of the store before making a purchase. This will help ensure that your information is safe and that you won't get scammed by an illegitimate retailer.\n\n#  What are some tips for safe and successful online shopping?\n\nWith the holiday season just around the corner, many people will be engaging in online shopping. While this can be a convenient and enjoyable experience, it’s important to keep some safety tips in mind. Here are a few suggestions to help ensure a safe and successful online shopping experience:\n\n- Only shop on reputable websites. Do your research and make sure you are visiting a legitimate site.\n\n- Use strong passwords and never use the same password for more than one account.\n\n- Keep your computer security up to date, including antivirus software and firewalls.\n\n- Make sure you are using up-to-date browsers with the latest security features enabled.\n\n- Check the website’s privacy policy and terms of service before you make any purchases.\n\n- Avoid clicking on any links or downloading any attachments from emails that seem suspicious.\n\n- Keep an eye on your account activity and contact your bank if you notice anything unusual.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help ensure a safe and enjoyable online shopping experience.\n\n#  What are some of the most popular online stores for fashion, beauty, and lifestyle items?\n\nOnline shopping is a popular way to purchase items, and there are many online stores that focus on fashion, beauty, and lifestyle items.

The tribesmen, who called themselves the JungleRaja, had never seen Europeans before and were naturally quite curious about these strange newcomers. The Dutchmen, in turn, were fascinated by the JungleRaja's way of life and decided to stay with them for a while to learn more about their customs.\n\nThe Dutchmen soon discovered that the JungleRaja were expert hunters and trackers, and were able to live off the land in complete harmony with their environment. They also found that the JungleRaja were a warlike people who did not take kindly to outsiders trespassing on their territory. Over time, the Dutchmen managed to gain the trust of the JungleRaja and even taught them how to make firearms and other modern tools.\n\nIn 1933, a group of Japanese soldiers traveled through the jungle and encountered the JungleRaja. Unlike the Dutchmen, the Japanese soldiers immediately began looting and pillaging the tribe's villages, taking whatever they could get their hands on. The JungleRaja fought back bravely but were no match for the well-armed Japanese troops. Many members of the tribe were killed or captured, while others fled into the jungle in hopes of finding safety.\n\nThe events that unfolded in 1933 would have a profound impact on JungleRaja society forever.

Ridho and Aya found it difficult to find good quality Indonesian food when they were travelling, so they decided to make it themselves.

The tribesmen, who called themselves the JungleRaja, had never seen Europeans before and were naturally quite curious about these strange newcomers. The Dutchmen, in turn, were fascinated by the JungleRaja's way of life and decided to stay with them for a while to learn more about their customs.\n\nThe Dutchmen soon discovered that the JungleRaja were expert hunters and trackers, and were able to live off the land in complete harmony with their environment. They also found that the JungleRaja were a warlike people who did not take kindly to outsiders trespassing on their territory. Over time, the Dutchmen managed to gain the trust of the JungleRaja and even taught them how to make firearms and other modern tools.\n\nIn 1933, a group of Japanese soldiers traveled through the jungle and encountered the JungleRaja. Unlike the Dutchmen, the Japanese soldiers immediately began looting and pillaging the tribe's villages, taking whatever they could get their hands on. The JungleRaja fought back bravely but were no match for the well-armed Japanese troops. Many members of the tribe were killed or captured, while others fled into the jungle in hopes of finding safety.\n\nThe events that unfolded in 1933 would have a profound impact on JungleRaja society forever. The tribe's contact with outsiders had shown them that there were much larger and more powerful civilizations beyond their isolated homeland, and this realization would eventually lead them to abandon their traditional way of life in favor of adopting modernity.\n\n#  Why was JungleRaja,Indonesia,Heller founded? \n\nThere are a variety of reasons as to why JungleRaja, Indonesia, Heller was founded.

Indonesia is an incredibly diverse country with so much to offer tourists; they wanted to create a business that would showcase the best of Indonesian culture and attract visitors from all over the world.\n\nFinally, JungleRaja was born out of necessity. Ridho and Aya found it difficult to find good quality Indonesian food when they were travelling, so they decided to make it themselves. They set up a small food stall in Bali and it was an instant success; people loved the authentic flavours and spices of their dishes. This gave them the confidence to take the next step and open their own restaurant in Jakarta.\n\nSo there you have it – three compelling reasons as to why JungleRaja, Indonesia, Heller came into existence!

The tax rates for casino winnings in Belgium are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Up to €999.99: 25%</li>\n<li>€1,000 - €2,499.99: 30%</li>\n<li>€2,500 - €5,999.99: 40%</li>\n<li>€6,000 - €11,999.99: 45%</li>\n<li>€12,000 and above: 50%</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"Are-casino-winnings-considered-income-in-Belgium\"><a href=\"#Are-casino-winnings-considered-income-in-Belgium\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Are casino winnings considered income in Belgium?\"></a>Are casino winnings considered income in Belgium?</h1><p>There is no definitive answer to this question since it depends on the specific circumstances in which the winnings were earned. However, in general, casino winnings are considered income for tax purposes in Belgium.</p>\n<p>This means that you will likely be required to pay taxes on any casino winnings that you receive. The amount of tax that you will have to pay will depend on your income level and other factors. You should speak to an accountant or tax specialist to get more information about how these taxes apply to you specifically.</p>\n<p>In some cases, you may be able to claim the winnings as a deduction on your tax return. This is something that you should discuss with a tax professional as well.</p>\n<p>It is important to keep in mind that while casino winnings are generally considered taxable income, there are certain exceptions. For example, if you receive a gambling prize worth less than €350, then it will not be taxed. Additionally, if you lose money gambling, then you may be able to claim this as a deduction on your taxes.</p>\n<h1 id=\"How-do-I-report-casino-winnings-on-my-tax-return-in-Belgium\"><a href=\"#How-do-I-report-casino-winnings-on-my-tax-return-in-Belgium\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How do I report casino winnings on my tax return in Belgium?\"></a>How do I report casino winnings on my tax return in Belgium?</h1><p>Belgium has a progressive income tax system, which means that your tax rate increases as your income increases. In 2018, the highest tax rate in Belgium was 47%.</p>\n<p>Reporting casino winnings on your Belgian tax return can be complicated, as it depends on your personal circumstances. In general, you will need to include any winnings from poker, roulette, blackjack, and other casino games in your taxable income. However, you may be able to deduct some of your losses from casino games.</p>\n<p>It is important to speak with a tax professional in Belgium to determine how much of your casino winnings are taxable. The amount of tax you pay on casino winnings will depend on factors such as your income level and the type of games you play.</p>\n<h1 id=\"If-I-have-gambling-losses-can-I-deduct-them-from-my-casino-winnings-in-Belgium\"><a href=\"#If-I-have-gambling-losses-can-I-deduct-them-from-my-casino-winnings-in-Belgium\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"If I have gambling losses, can I deduct them from my casino winnings in Belgium?\"></a>If I have gambling losses, can I deduct them from my casino winnings in Belgium?</h1><p>The answer to this question is yes, you can deduct your gambling losses from your casino winnings in Belgium. However, there are certain conditions that must be met in order for you to qualify for this deduction.</p>\n<p>First of all, the amount of your gambling losses must exceed the amount of your casino winnings. Secondly, you must be able to provide proof of your gambling losses. This proof can come in the form of receipts, cancelled checks, or other documentation that confirms the amount of your gambling losses.</p>\n<p>If you meet these requirements, you can deduct your gambling losses from your casino winnings when filing your income tax return. However, it is important to keep in mind that this deduction will only reduce your taxable income; it will not result in a refund of any money that you have already paid taxes on.</p>\n"},{"title":"Indian Casino to Open Near Seattle in Spring of 2019","date":"2022-10-06T06:49:20.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  Indian Casino to Open Near Seattle in Spring of 2019\n\nThe Tulalip Tribes of Washington have announced that they will open a new Indian casino near Seattle in the spring of 2019. The $425 million project, which is considered the largest tribal investment in state history, is expected to create 1,500 jobs and attract an additional 600,000 visitors to the region each year.\n\nThe casino will be located on a 122-acre site in Tukwila and will include a hotel, restaurant, entertainment venue, and conference center. The tribe has already invested $101 million in the project, which will be funded in part by revenue from its existing gaming operations.\n\nAccording to tribal officials, the new casino will offer a \"Las Vegas-style experience\" that is not currently available in the Seattle area. It will feature gaming options such as blackjack, roulette, and craps, as well as electronic table games and a high-limit room.\n\nThe Tulalip Tribes believe that the casino will help to stimulate economic growth in the region and are eager to get it up and running. \"This has been more than a decade in the making,\" said Chairman Mel Sheldon Jr. \"A lot of hard work has gone into this project, but we're confident that it will be worth the wait.\"\n\n#  $100 Million Project to Bring Indian Gaming to Washington\n\nThe Spokane Tribe of Indians has announced a $100 million project to bring Indian gaming to Washington. The tribe has acquired 190 acres of land near Fort Spokane and plans to build a casino, hotel, and conference center.\n\nThe Spokane Tribe is one of the 12 federally recognized tribes in Washington. It has more than 2,000 members and is headquartered in Wellpinit, Washington. The tribe has been working on the project for more than two years, and it is expected to create more than 1,000 jobs.\n\nThe project still needs approval from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, but if approved, construction could begin as early as 2019. The tribe plans to finance the project with its own money and with tribal bonds.\n\nIndian gaming is a big business in the United States. There are more than 450 Indian casinos in 28 states, and they generate more than $34 billion in revenue each year. Washington has 11 Indian casinos, which generate more than $1 billion in revenue each year.\n\nThe Spokane Tribe's casino would be the first off-reservation casino in Washington. It would be located just east of Spokane and north of Coulee Dam on Highway 2. The tribe said it chose the location because it is close to major population centers and has good transportation infrastructure.\n\n#  Washington's First Indian Casino to Open in Spring of 2019\n\nThe Snoqualmie Tribe, located in Washington State, will soon be opening its new casino near Seattle. The tribe has been working on the project since 2007, and it is now slated to open in Spring of 2019.\n\nThe casino will be called \"Snoqualmie Casino & Resort\" and it will include a 210-room hotel, a 12,000 sq. ft. spa, and a variety of restaurants. In addition to the gaming floor, the casino will also offer conference space, wedding venues, and a bowling alley.\n\nThe Snoqualmie Tribe is excited about the new casino and believes that it will be a major attraction for tourists in the Seattle area. The tribe has already invested over $100 million in the project and plans to spend an additional $40 million on marketing and promotions.\n\nWashington has been without any Indian casinos since 2004, when the Cowlitz Tribe's casino was shut down by the state government. That closure left Seattle as the largest city in the United States without a casino.\n\nIt's unclear how the new Snoqualmie Casino & Resort will compete with existing casinos in Seattle such as Mohegan Sun Pacific Northwest (formerly known as Ilani), Emerald Queen Casino, and Great American Casino. Those casinos are all much larger than the new Snoqualmie facility, and they also offer more slot machines and gaming tables.\n\n#  Sakura Legend to be Washington's First Indian Casino\n\nAfter years of negotiation and planning, the Tulalip Tribes of Washington State have announced that they will open Sakura Legend, the first Indian casino in the state. The new casino is scheduled to open in early 2020 and will create over 1,000 jobs.\n\nThe Tulalips are a federally recognized tribe with over 10,000 members. The tribe has been pushing for a casino since the early 1990s, when they opened their first gaming facility, Quil Ceda Creek Casino. That casino was small and located in a rural area, but it served as a prototype for the larger and more modern Sakura Legend.\n\nThe new casino will be located in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle. It will feature over 2,500 slot machines and 150 table games. In addition to creating jobs, the casino will also generate significant revenue for the tribe. The Tulalips operate several other businesses, including a hotel and two golf courses, and the casino will help them to expand those businesses and create new ones.\n\nThe opening of Sakura Legend is good news for Washington State residents. Not only will it create jobs and generate revenue, but it will also provide much-needed competition for existing casinos in the area. This should lead to better deals for players and more entertainment options.\n\n#  Construction Begins on Washington's First Indian Casino\n\nThe Tulalip Tribes of Washington marked an important milestone this week with the groundbreaking of their new $700 million casino. The project, which is the first Indian casino to be built in the state, will create over 2,000 jobs and bring much-needed economic development to the region.\n\n\"This is a very exciting day for our tribe,\" said Chairman Mel Sheldon Jr. \"Our new casino will create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for our people.\"\n\nThe new casino will be built on a 140-acre site adjacent to the Tribe's resort hotel. It will include a gaming floor with approximately 2,500 slots and 75 table games, as well as a variety of restaurants and other amenities.\n\nThe Tulalips have been working on the project for years, and have already invested millions of dollars in planning and development.

But the top 10% of earners take home an average salary of £45,000 (US$58,800), while the top 1% boast an annual income of £75,000 (US$97,800).\n\nThe news will come as music to the ears of those working in casinos across the country – and could rival the wages on offer in other high-paying industries such as finance or law.\n\nSo what exactly puts casino dealers in pole position when it comes to earning potential? It’s all down to tips from players.\n\n“It’s no secret that casino dealers can make a lot of money from tips, especially if they work in a high-roller room or for a VIP table,” says careers expert Lynn Taylor. “But even those who work on regular tables can earn a healthy salary from gratuities. In fact, many casinos have policies that state dealers must be tipped for providing good service.”\n\nAnd it’s not just those at the top of the pay scale who benefit from generous tipping. Casino floor staff – such as croupiers, pit bosses and supervisors – can also make supplementary income from gratuities on top of their basic salary.\n\nSo if you’re looking for a well-paid job with good tips, a career as a casino dealer could be just the thing for you.\n\n#  Casino Dealers rake in over $50,000 in tips during a season!\n\nWhile some casino dealers may start out with a salary as low as $25,000 per year, they can make much more in tips. In fact, many dealers take home more than $50,000 during a season.\n\nThe amount of tips a dealer takes in depends on a number of factors, including the type of casino, the size of the casino, and the number of players at the table. However, most dealers report taking home an average of $20-$30 per hour in tips.\n\nThere are a few things that you can do to ensure that you leave your dealer with a bountiful tip. First, be sure to observe proper etiquette at the table. Don't talk loudly or blow on your cards. Second, try to tip consistent amounts for each hand. Finally, be generous when it comes to tipping big jackpot winners.\n\nIf you're looking for a way to show your appreciation for a job well done, tipping your dealer is a great way to do it!\n\n#  Highest tipped casino dealer in an England League Game makes $6,000 in one day!\n\nA casino dealer in Sunderland, England made an impressive $6,000 in a single day after receiving some high tips from players. The lucky dealer was working at the Genting Casino when a number of large bets came in, boosting their income for the day.\n\nThe Genting Casino is one of the largest in England and is known for its high-stakes gambling. With games like blackjack and roulette available, it's no surprise that some players like to go all out with their bets. This can lead to some seriously big payouts for dealers and staff working at the casino.\n\nIn this case, the Sunderland dealer was more than happy to take home an extra $6,000 on top of their regular wage. It's definitely an exciting way to make a living and shows just how lucrative casino work can be. If you're looking for a career that comes with plenty of excitement and potential for big rewards, then casino work may be just what you're looking for!\n\n#  How much money do casino dealers really make? \n\nIf you’re looking for a high-paying career that doesn’t require a lot of education or experience, then becoming a casino dealer may be the right fit for you. But how much can you expect to make as a casino dealer?\n\nThe answer to this question depends on a number of factors, including the casino where you work, the type of game you deal, and your experience level. However, most casino dealers earn an hourly wage that ranges from $8 to $22.\n\nIn addition to their hourly wage, casino dealers also typically receive tips from players. How much you make in tips will depend on your ability to interact with players and your skill at dealing cards or spinning roulette wheels. Some dealers can earn tips in excess of $100 per hour, while others may only make a few dollars per hour.\n\nSo what’s the bottom line? Casino dealers can make a good living, but it’s not always easy money. The best way to find out exactly how much money you can expect to make as a casino dealer is to speak with employers in your area.\n\n#  Casino Dealers bring home an average of $71,000 annually\n\nCasino dealers earn a median wage of $11.68 an hour, or about $24,000 a year. But with tips, many dealers can make much more. The average annual salary for casino dealers, including both hourly wages and tips, is $71,000.\n\nThe best-paid 10 percent of casino dealers earn more than $92,000 a year. And while the lowest-paid 10 percent earn less than $18,000 a year, most casino dealers in that group still make more than the national median wage of $11.68 an hour.\n\nMost casino dealers work for gaming companies that operate casinos or gaming tables at other locations such as hotels, racetracks or cruise ships. Some work in card rooms where people can gamble using their own money.\n\nMany casinos are also looking for dealers who can speak multiple languages to cater to international guests.\n\nThe job of casino dealer has been around since the early days of gambling and it has evolved along with the industry. Dealers used to be known as croupiers, from the French word meaning “counter” or “banker.” \n\nAs gambling has expanded around the world, so has the need for dealers who can communicate with players in different languages. Today there are dealers who speak English, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese and other languages in casinos around the globe.\n\nThere are no formal education requirements to become a casino dealer. However, many casinos prefer to hire employees who have some knowledge of card games and basic math skills. Previous customer service experience is also helpful. \n\nDealers typically go through a training program at the casino where they will be working before they start dealing cards or spinning roulette wheels for guests.","source":"_posts/Casino-Dealers-in-England-League-Game-can-make-up-to-$100K-Annually!.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Casino Dealers in England League Game can make up to $100K Annually!\ndate: 2022-10-27 16:39:07\ncategories:\n- Online Casino\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  Casino Dealers in England League Game can make up to $100K Annually!\n\nCasino dealers in England can make up to $100,000 annually, new data suggests.\n\nThe average wage for a casino dealer in the UK is around £21,600 (US$27,700), according to research by jobs site Glassdoor.

This season they look poised to break through and make a run at the Finals. One of the reasons they’re so successful is their ability to play as a team.\n\nAs with any team sport, chemistry is key. And the Spurs have that in spades.\n\nThis was on display during a game against the Golden State Warriors in February. The Warriors were up by 5 points with just over 2 minutes left in the game. But the Spurs weren’t done yet. They rallied back and tied the game with seconds left on the clock. Then they went on to win in overtime.\n\nThat kind of resilience is a testament to how close this team is. They never give up, no matter what the situation is.\n\nAnd their chemistry isn’t just reserved for crunch time moments either. It extends to off-the-court activities too. For example, earlier this year Manu Ginobili hosted an event called “Hoops and Hugs” which brought together current and former Spurs players for a day of fun and charity work.\n\nThis event is just another example of how tight knit this team really is. They do things not just for themselves, but for each other as well. And that’s a big reason why they continue to be successful year after year.\n\n#  Spurs Come Up Short in Poker rake Race\n\nThe poker world is eagerly watching the competition between PokerStars and 888Poker to become the top poker site. In the latest bidding war, the two companies are vying for a new market: Spanish players.\n\n888Poker just announced it will offer rake-free games to Spanish players in an effort to lure them away from PokerStars. This comes after PokerStars announced it will increase its rake in Spain by 10%.\n\nSpanish players generate a lot of revenue for online poker sites. In 2015, they accounted for $108 million in rake, making them the second-biggest market behind the United States.\n\n888Poker currently has a slight lead over PokerStars in Spain, but PokerStars is still the dominant player in the country. The company has more than 2 million Spanish players, compared to 888Poker’s 600,000.\n\n888Poker is hoping its new rake-free offer will give it the edge it needs to catch up to PokerStars. The company is also offering sign-up bonuses of up to €1,000 for new players.\n\nIt’s unclear how this new offer will impact the Spanish market. It could start a price war between the two companies, driving down profits for both of them. Or it could prompt more Spanish players to switch to 888Poker, giving them a significant advantage over PokerStars.\n\nTime will tell who wins this battle for Spanish players. In the meantime, both companies are likely to continue increasing their rake in order to gain an edge over their competitors.\n\n#  How Much Does Casino Rake Affect Your Winnings?\n\nCasinos have what is called a rake, which is the percentage of each bet that the house takes. This percentage can vary from casino to casino, and even game to game. In some games, the rake can be as little as 2 percent, while in others it can be as high as 10 percent or more. So how does this percentage affect your bottom line?\n\nTo answer that question, we need to take a look at the math behind it. Let's say you're playing a game where the rake is 5 percent. For every $100 you bet, the house takes $5, leaving you with $95. Now let's assume you're betting against a 50/50 odds game- in other words, you have a 50 percent chance of winning each time you make a bet. If you make 10 bets in a row, your expected value (EV) would be $0 since EV is just the average amount of money you'll win or lose on each bet. However, because of the rake, you'd actually end up losing $5 in the long run- meaning that casino has effectively seized 5 percent of your bankroll.\n\nIn games with lower rakes, like blackjack or craps, the impact of the house edge is less pronounced. However, in games with higher rakes like slots or video poker, that 5 percent can really start to eat away at your profits. So before you sit down at your next casino table, be sure to check out the rake and make sure it's something you're comfortable with- after all, there's no point in playing if the casino is going to take more than your expected return!\n\n#  Do Poker Players Have to Pay Casino Rake?\n\nCasino rake is the money that the casino charges the poker players for playing in the casino. Poker rooms usually take 5% of each pot, but the percentage can vary depending on the room and the game. This article discusses whether or not poker players have to pay casino rake.\n\nTraditionally, casino rake has been seen as a necessary expense in order to keep the poker games running. However, this view is changing as more and more poker rooms offer no-rake games. In fact, some rooms are now even offering rake-free tournaments.\n\nSo does this mean that poker players no longer have to pay casino rake? The answer is no - at least, not yet. While some rooms are experimenting with no-rake games, the vast majority of rooms still charge a rake. And until this changes, poker players will need to continue paying casino rake.\n\n#  What is Casino Rake and How Does it Affect My Winnings?\n\nCasino rake is defined as a commission that the house takes on each hand of poker. It’s essentially the price of playing at a casino and is collected by the dealer. The rake goes towards compensating the casino for its expenses in hosting the game, as well as incentivizing house players to compete against those sitting at the table.\n\nThe percentage taken from each pot depends on the stakes of the game, but typically falls between 2% and 5%. This means that for every $100 wagered in a hand, the house would take between $2 and $5. In some cases, particularly high-stakes games, the rake can be even higher.\n\nThere are also variations on how rake is collected – it can either be taken before or after each hand depending on the casino. However, most casinos use post-rake methods, which means that players have to pay their rake before they leave the table.\n\nFor players, casino rake can have a significant impact on their overall winnings. In addition to eating into your potential profits, it also reduces your chance of winning since you’re basically playing against an opponent who has an advantage (the house). This is why it’s important to always factor in rake when deciding whether or not to play a particular game.\n\nIn spite of this, however, poker remains one of the most popular casino games around thanks to its exciting action and potential for big wins. With careful bankroll management and a bit of luck, you could very well come out ahead in the end.","source":"_posts/Spurs-Make-a-Strong-Case-in-the-Rake-Race.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Spurs Make a Strong Case in the Rake Race\ndate: 2022-11-02 09:45:05\ncategories:\n- Casino Game\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  Spurs Make a Strong Case in the Rake Race\n\nThe Spurs are one of the NBA’s most successful teams in recent memory, making it to the playoffs for 21 straight years.

However, because of the rake, you'd actually end up losing $5 in the long run- meaning that casino has effectively seized 5 percent of your bankroll.\n\nIn games with lower rakes, like blackjack or craps, the impact of the house edge is less pronounced. However, in games with higher rakes like slots or video poker, that 5 percent can really start to eat away at your profits. So before you sit down at your next casino table, be sure to check out the rake and make sure it's something you're comfortable with- after all, there's no point in playing if the casino is going to take more than your expected return!\n\n#  Do Poker Players Have to Pay Casino Rake?\n\nCasino rake is the money that the casino charges the poker players for playing in the casino. Poker rooms usually take 5% of each pot, but the percentage can vary depending on the room and the game. This article discusses whether or not poker players have to pay casino rake.\n\nTraditionally, casino rake has been seen as a necessary expense in order to keep the poker games running. However, this view is changing as more and more poker rooms offer no-rake games. In fact, some rooms are now even offering rake-free tournaments.\n\nSo does this mean that poker players no longer have to pay casino rake? The answer is no - at least, not yet. While some rooms are experimenting with no-rake games, the vast majority of rooms still charge a rake. And until this changes, poker players will need to continue paying casino rake.\n\n#  What is Casino Rake and How Does it Affect My Winnings?\n\nCasino rake is defined as a commission that the house takes on each hand of poker. It’s essentially the price of playing at a casino and is collected by the dealer. The rake goes towards compensating the casino for its expenses in hosting the game, as well as incentivizing house players to compete against those sitting at the table.\n\nThe percentage taken from each pot depends on the stakes of the game, but typically falls between 2% and 5%. This means that for every $100 wagered in a hand, the house would take between $2 and $5. In some cases, particularly high-stakes games, the rake can be even higher.\n\nThere are also variations on how rake is collected – it can either be taken before or after each hand depending on the casino. However, most casinos use post-rake methods, which means that players have to pay their rake before they leave the table.\n\nFor players, casino rake can have a significant impact on their overall winnings. In addition to eating into your potential profits, it also reduces your chance of winning since you’re basically playing against an opponent who has an advantage (the house). This is why it’s important to always factor in rake when deciding whether or not to play a particular game.\n\nIn spite of this, however, poker remains one of the most popular casino games around thanks to its exciting action and potential for big wins. With careful bankroll management and a bit of luck, you could very well come out ahead in the end.","slug":"Spurs-Make-a-Strong-Case-in-the-Rake-Race","published":1,"updated":"2022-11-02T01:45:05.144Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cl9yz87tj0000zgv5aehjck0x","content":"<h1 id=\"Spurs-Make-a-Strong-Case-in-the-Rake-Race\"><a href=\"#Spurs-Make-a-Strong-Case-in-the-Rake-Race\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Spurs Make a Strong Case in the Rake Race\"></a>Spurs Make a Strong Case in the Rake Race</h1><p>The Spurs are one of the NBA’s most successful teams in recent memory, making it to the playoffs for 21 straight years.
